Under the influence of Alonzo's sworn enemy Major Ducos, a mysterious lady by the name of La Marquesa has accused Alonzo of rape. Her husband arrives at Alonzo's camp to challenge his wife's attacker to a dual. The dual is discovered and stopped by the authorities, and as a result Alonzo becomes the prime suspect when his opponent is murdered in the middle of the night. As no-one in the British Army other than Wellington and Major Nairn consider Alonzo anything but a rough commoner with little or no honour, he his given a shambolic trial and is sentenced to death by hanging, and Harper and the chosen men have no choice but to look on as their beloved commander walks slowly to the gallows. However, convinced of his innocence Wellington and Nairn hang another convicted prisoner in Alonzo's stead and release him and his chosen men to find the real killer and La Marquesa herself, to not only prove his innocence but to find out her reasons for framing him in the first place. Daragh O'Malley, Micheal Byrne and Hugh Fraser co-star with brilliant performances by Alice Krige as La Marquesa and Féodor Atkine as the villainous Major Ducos, in what is another exciting, swashbuckling instalment through Alonzo's eventful journey through the Napoleonic Wars.\"\n",
