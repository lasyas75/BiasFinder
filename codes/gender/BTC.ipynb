       "\"I hated the book. A guy meets a smart dog, gets a virgin girlfriend, and all the while they're being chased by a hitman and a ape beast thing ( both of whom want the dog). Dean Koontz really can't write ( I read the book at my sister's recommendation, I should have known better). When I saw this, ( mostly out of a morbid curiosity) I actually found myself criticizing it because of the fact that it was untrue to the book, even though this is a book that its impossible to make a good movie of. I figured at least if they're going to make a film adaptation of the worst book I've ever read the filmmakers might as well be accurate. They turned the guy and his virgin love interest into a boy and his mother, for some reason that bothered me most of all ( even though I seriously doubt keeping it a guy and his chick wouldn't have made it any better). Quite simply; bad book, bad movie, don't see it.\""
