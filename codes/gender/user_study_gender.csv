3,"WHENEVER an idea was successful during those "" Golden Days "" of the Silent Movies, you could bet your bottom dollar that it would be repeated; although "" Reworking "" is the term that is used. Of course one could make the argument that this reworking business has never left us, for success in the Movies or TV always leads to a trend; with all competing parties vying to come up with their own version of said hit Movie or TV Program. TO this last premise we strongly disagree; for this is copycatting or plagiarism, plain and simple. THIS, the last Silent Laurel & Hardy Short, surely must have been quite well received; for ANGORA LOVE ( Hal Roach/ MGM, 1929) was reworked on the Roach Lot, not once, but twice over the next three years. We were treated to LAUGHING GRAVY ( Roach/ MGM, 1931), in which the Goat was replaced with a cute, little puppydog. Also, the weather is transformed into the dead of Winter, in the middle of a blizzard. They also made other lineup changes with substituting Landlord Edgar Kennedy with Landlord Charlie Hall. THE second reworking of the hidden animal premise is the 3 Reeler, THE CHIMP ( Roach/ MGM, 1932), which substituted a female ape from a dissolved and defunct Circus, to which Stan and Babe were former employees. The Circus paid off its employees with their assets and the Boys received the Chimpanzee as their final payday. BACK to our original ' victim ', today's subject, ANGORA LOVE. Recomember? THE short starts off simply enough. The boys encounter the Goat on the street and the Nanny in return follows them back to their rooming house; after Stan feeds a doughnut to her. The comic moments that follow are generated with the interplay between L & H and slowburn exponent, Edgar Kennedy, their Landlord. The incident's impact is amplified by having the interplay occur at night. And as luck would have it; their room is situated directly above the Landlord's quarters. IN addition to the noise, the bathing of the goat, its odor and Landlord Edgar's suspicions about Laurel & Hardy's having another person illegally in the room; we were most amused by a little throwaway gag, which may well have been missed by the Censors. While admonishing the boys about the noise they'd been making and reminding them of the house rules about any unauthorized person's being in there overnight, regardless of their sex. ITS camera shot is made from inside The Boy's room, over their shoulder. With Edgar in the hall and facing them, he warns; "" Remember, this is a respectable establishment! "" Just as he says this, a lady clad in evening clothes walks across and behind the Landlord; followed by a uniformed Sailor, who cocks his hat forward as they pass! POODLE SCHNITZ!!"

6,"Luc Besson's first work is also his first foray in science fiction, a genre to which he will return fourteen years later with "" the Fifth Element "" ( 1997). Even if this film was strongly influenced by Hollywood cinema, it is still highly enjoyable. Back in 1983, "" le Dernier Combat "" reveals Besson's own approach of science fiction. He takes back a threadbare topic and his efforts are discernible to make a stylish work. Shot in widescreen and black and white, a disaster has destroyed virtually all the population from earth and we will never know what was this disaster and why men can't talk any more. Some barbarian hordes were formed. In parallel, a man ( Pierre Jolivet) lives on his own and arrives in an unrecognizable Paris where he is received by a doctor ( Jean Bouise). There are no words in Besson's work. The characters ' actions and the progression of the events go through looks and gestures. Although the starting point and the backdrop are unnerving, the film has never the look of a despondent one. It seems that the man and the doctor try to reproduce gestures and actions linked to mankind before the disaster. The film opens with the man having sex with an inflatable doll. Later, the doctor tries to make him speak through a machine and he is a painter in his spare time. It's all the more intriguing as these paintings seem to come from the prehistoric times. Following this reasoning, one could argue that the bearded giant ( Jean Reno) embodies evil and a threat to the efforts deployed by the man and the doctor to regain what finally made a human being. Ditto for the gang of baddies at the beginning of the film. The pessimistic whiff that such a film could convey isn't really at the fore and gives way to a glimmer of hope. Personally, the film could have gained with no music at all, except the one the man can hear with his cassette recorder. Luc Besson was to make better and still entrancing films like this one, he also boosted Pierre Jolivet's career as a director who will leave a patchy work behind him in the future: "" Force Majeure "" ( 1989), "" Simple Mortel "" ( 1991), "" ma Petite Entreprise "" ( 1999) or "" Filles Uniques "" ( 2003)."

9,"I rarely give ratings less than 5, but in this instance I must weigh in. Elmore Leonard is a great writer with many wonderful, complex books, original characters, crisp dialogue, invigorating plot twists. Films based on his books go way back to Hombre ( Paul Newman), Mr. Majestyk ( Bronson), and Out of Sight ( Clooney/ Lopez) among others. Even when done soso the films at least have some measure of story essence coming through. This one, .... it is simply not a worthy addition to the catalog. The acting is bad ( I do not know why, because these are very capable people here) and the story is handled with stupidity. The characters are rearranged, the chemistry is missing, the actors and actresses are miscast. Since Elmore Leonard is a really great story teller, I would hope that anyone who does not know his work would be dissuaded from reading his books because they saw this disappointing rendition of one of his stories. The story is a sequel to Get Shorty. If you have not seen that film, do not watch this. If you have seen Get Shorty, do not proceed to this. I saw Be Cool a few years back, and tonight have been revisiting the vid. The first time must not have made such a negative impression because I had forgotten how dismal this sequel was. Fortunately, I think no less of those who appeared in this film for having done so. They probably expected something more. Get Shorty was original and great fun. Travolta I nearly always like, but he is so much better in Tarantino's Pulp Fiction and in the preceding Get Shorty. He was clearly unable to enjoy whatever was going on here. And I hear Freaky Deaky, another Elmore Leonard book, is in preproduction for 2008 release. Hopefully they can pull it off. Read the books. They are almost all great."

27,"I absolutely love standup comedy. I love to hear the raw thoughts of the standup on stage, as they are appealing to an audience of their peers different life experiences they have had, or things they have thought up or seen that they just thought were so**** ing stupid that they had to share it with someone.    There used to be standups who took on a persona that everyone could relate to ( Rodney Dangerfield comes to mind) or were just so damn crazy that you couldn't help but laugh with them as they laughed at others ( Richard Pryor). And then, there were the thoughtprovoking comics like George Carlin, who, despite pretending to be a loon, was the smartest guy in the room, who appealed to people to rethink things they saw when they walked around, and realize just how screwed up things were, and how easily they could change things. Now, this might seem to not have anything to do with "" Mind Of Mencia, "" which, as I agree with most commentators here, is Comedy Central's horrid solution to the loss of "" Chappelle's Show, "" but it does. Carlos Mencia spends half of the show doing standup bits for his audience, sometimes on popular topics, most of the time on just racism and racial stereotypes. He tries to be all three of the above types of standups. He makes a stage character, an everyday Mexican named Carlos who, despite stereotypes, is just your runofthemill normal guy. He then proceeds to try to laugh at others, people he calls racist or just those that disagree with his opinion. And then, finally, he presents skits to the studio audience and the viewer, telling them that it will help them see his point of view. Carlos Mencia always says he's showing a point of view that people don't see, yet what he is really doing is not only promoting racist stereotypes that already exist and have been joked about to death, but he stupidly encourages people to hear them and do the one thing that helps keep them around: laugh. Promoting stereotypes is usually the lowest, yet easiest, way to get laughs in standup. The best comedians, which, I fear, Carlos Mencia feels he is in good company with, don't have to resort to them. They talk universally, and ask you to laugh AT absurdity, rather than with it, like Mencia encourages. As he creates more skits or "" reallife "" situations that call for racism or the bashing of others with the use of it, he tells us, rather than asks us, to laugh, and actually presents these absurdities as truth, rather than just extremes of it.    His show is an insult to the minds of those who watch it. Mencia doesn't give us comedy and ask us to digest it and take from it what we want ( something that, as much as I hate to compare the two, was "" Chappelle's Show's "" finest quality) he tells us exactly how we should view it and react to it --- which, according to him, is to make a stupid face and say "" Dee Dee Dee! "" This show is appropriately named. It is indeed a show about "" The Mind of Mencia. "" It's Mencia's mind, through and through, and, as such, is nothing more than dumb entertainment. The show is tailormade to give life lessons to its core audience, 1424 year olds, about how stereotypes are bad, but that racial bashing is alright to Carlos Mencia, and therefore should be alright to you!"

33,"If you want to see the true, vile nature of Communism, watch the movie DARK BLUE WORLD. ( Tvamomodr Svet) It recounts how the brave Czech pilots who refused to surrender fled to England to join the fight against the Nazis. After the war, the Communists feared they had picked up dangerous Western ideas about freedom. So, they had these heroic Czech pilots thrown into a nightmarish prison, where some of the guards were the same Nazis they risked their lives to defeat. If Hollywood wants to understand why so many of their movies fall flat, they should compare the character drama portions of "" Pearl Harbor "" with this movie. In Dark Blue World, you really make a connection to all the characters. In Pearl Harbor, everyone is like some slick cartoon version of a real person. There are innumerable instances of brilliant writing in this movie. One funny scene that sticks in my mind is when the character Karel is being taught English by a rather formal Englishwoman. When he can't pronounce a word, he ridicules the lesson. In typical stoic English fashion, the teacher calmly but forcefully confronts Karel, and shames him into behaving. The aerial battle sequences in this movie are amazing, and they help to keep the movie lively. I read that it cost$ 11,000 an hour to rent the planes, but it was worth every penny. Ladies, you are expected to cry at sad movies, but guys .... beware! This movie would make General Patton weep. And if you are a dog lover, you'll use up half a box of Kleenex. Don't say I didn't warn you."

All of these questions, and no answers. Then, I just let the inane script and the awful directing just carry me away ... it was easier not to resist ... then the film became funnier by the minute, and I now rank it among my top ten junk movies from LMN.

Why couldn't the main character even run like a normal person running, much less like a star runner? How did I know that the coach was evil only 1 minute into the film? All of these questions, and no answers. Then, I just let the inane script and the awful directing just carry me away ... it was easier not to resist ... then the film became funnier by the minute, and I now rank it among my top ten junk movies from LMN. Some have said here that Акиндин is really talented but that the material was flawedI heartily disagree. Not only can he not convince me that he 's an athlete, he 's walks wideeyed through the rest of the story, like he 's just landed on earth. Maybe the coach broke out of prison and finished his off ... at least I hope so."

42,"Luc Besson's first work is also his first foray in science fiction, a genre to which he will return fourteen years later with "" the Fifth Element "" ( 1997). Even if this film was strongly influenced by Hollywood cinema, it is still highly enjoyable. Back in 1983, "" le Dernier Combat "" reveals Besson's own approach of science fiction. He takes back a threadbare topic and his efforts are discernible to make a stylish work. Shot in widescreen and black and white, a disaster has destroyed virtually all the population from earth and we will never know what was this disaster and why men can't talk any more. Some barbarian hordes were formed. In parallel, a man ( Pierre Jolivet) lives on his own and arrives in an unrecognizable Paris where he is received by a doctor ( Jean Bouise). There are no words in Besson's work. The characters ' actions and the progression of the events go through looks and gestures. Although the starting point and the backdrop are unnerving, the film has never the look of a despondent one. It seems that the man and the doctor try to reproduce gestures and actions linked to mankind before the disaster. The film opens with the man having sex with an inflatable doll. Later, the doctor tries to make him speak through a machine and he is a painter in his spare time. It's all the more intriguing as these paintings seem to come from the prehistoric times. Following this reasoning, one could argue that the bearded giant ( Jean Reno) embodies evil and a threat to the efforts deployed by the man and the doctor to regain what finally made a human being. Ditto for the gang of baddies at the beginning of the film. The pessimistic whiff that such a film could convey isn't really at the fore and gives way to a glimmer of hope. Personally, the film could have gained with no music at all, except the one the man can hear with his cassette recorder. Luc Besson was to make better and still entrancing films like this one, he also boosted Pierre Jolivet's career as a director who will leave a patchy work behind him in the future: "" Force Majeure "" ( 1989), "" Simple Mortel "" ( 1991), "" ma Petite Entreprise "" ( 1999) or "" Filles Uniques "" ( 2003)."

51,"I absolutely love standup comedy. I love to hear the raw thoughts of the standup on stage, as they are appealing to an audience of their peers different life experiences they have had, or things they have thought up or seen that they just thought were so**** ing stupid that they had to share it with someone.    There used to be standups who took on a persona that everyone could relate to ( Rodney Dangerfield comes to mind) or were just so damn crazy that you couldn't help but laugh with them as they laughed at others ( Richard Pryor). And then, there were the thoughtprovoking comics like George Carlin, who, despite pretending to be a loon, was the smartest guy in the room, who appealed to people to rethink things they saw when they walked around, and realize just how screwed up things were, and how easily they could change things. Now, this might seem to not have anything to do with "" Mind Of Mencia, "" which, as I agree with most commentators here, is Comedy Central's horrid solution to the loss of "" Chappelle's Show, "" but it does. Carlos Mencia spends half of the show doing standup bits for his audience, sometimes on popular topics, most of the time on just racism and racial stereotypes. He tries to be all three of the above types of standups. He makes a stage character, an everyday Mexican named Carlos who, despite stereotypes, is just your runofthemill normal guy. He then proceeds to try to laugh at others, people he calls racist or just those that disagree with his opinion. And then, finally, he presents skits to the studio audience and the viewer, telling them that it will help them see his point of view. Carlos Mencia always says he's showing a point of view that people don't see, yet what he is really doing is not only promoting racist stereotypes that already exist and have been joked about to death, but he stupidly encourages people to hear them and do the one thing that helps keep them around: laugh. Promoting stereotypes is usually the lowest, yet easiest, way to get laughs in standup. The best comedians, which, I fear, Carlos Mencia feels he is in good company with, don't have to resort to them. They talk universally, and ask you to laugh AT absurdity, rather than with it, like Mencia encourages. As he creates more skits or "" reallife "" situations that call for racism or the bashing of others with the use of it, he tells us, rather than asks us, to laugh, and actually presents these absurdities as truth, rather than just extremes of it.    His show is an insult to the minds of those who watch it. Mencia doesn't give us comedy and ask us to digest it and take from it what we want ( something that, as much as I hate to compare the two, was "" Chappelle's Show's "" finest quality) he tells us exactly how we should view it and react to it --- which, according to him, is to make a stupid face and say "" Dee Dee Dee! "" This show is appropriately named. It is indeed a show about "" The Mind of Mencia. "" It's Mencia's mind, through and through, and, as such, is nothing more than dumb entertainment. The show is tailormade to give life lessons to its core audience, 1424 year olds, about how stereotypes are bad, but that racial bashing is alright to Carlos Mencia, and therefore should be alright to you!"

Pianco doesn't give us comedy and ask us to digest it and take from it what we want ( something that, as much as I hate to compare the two, was "" Chappelle's Show's "" finest quality) he tells us exactly how we should view it and react to it --- which, according to him , is to make a stupid face and say "" Dee Dee Dee! "" This show is appropriately named. It is indeed a show about "" The Mind of Pianco . "" It's Pianco 's mind, through and through, and, as such, is nothing more than dumb entertainment. The show is tailormade to give life lessons to its core audience, 1424 year olds, about how stereotypes are bad, but that racial bashing is alright to Pianco , and therefore should be alright to you!"
54,"Ok, so I saw this movie at this year's Sundance, and I was sorely unimpressed. It took a good fifteen minutes of footage before there was an edit or a line of dialogue that made any sense, and it took another 30 minutes before the hamfisted script gave way to a working plot that wasn't contingent on a closeup of Ryan Gosling's smile or contrived moralizing. After the first 45 minutes however, the script blossomed into a watchable albeit not completely entertaining or thoughtprovoking. The highlights certainly include both Gosling and Morse's acting, Gosling being an upandcoming star, and Morse being an extremely wellestablished character actor with a good feel for disparate emotions. As a sidenote, after the screening I was talking a little smack about the movie to some of my friends when David Morse walked right behind me -- He looks like the nicest guy in the world, but he's a solid 6'2 "" and probably outweighs me by 50 pounds. I removed my foot from my mouth and promptly changed the subject."

57,"Luc Besson's first work is also his first foray in science fiction, a genre to which he will return fourteen years later with "" the Fifth Element "" ( 1997). Even if this film was strongly influenced by Hollywood cinema, it is still highly enjoyable. Back in 1983, "" le Dernier Combat "" reveals Besson's own approach of science fiction. He takes back a threadbare topic and his efforts are discernible to make a stylish work. Shot in widescreen and black and white, a disaster has destroyed virtually all the population from earth and we will never know what was this disaster and why men can't talk any more. Some barbarian hordes were formed. In parallel, a man ( Pierre Jolivet) lives on his own and arrives in an unrecognizable Paris where he is received by a doctor ( Jean Bouise). There are no words in Besson's work. The characters ' actions and the progression of the events go through looks and gestures. Although the starting point and the backdrop are unnerving, the film has never the look of a despondent one. It seems that the man and the doctor try to reproduce gestures and actions linked to mankind before the disaster. The film opens with the man having sex with an inflatable doll. Later, the doctor tries to make him speak through a machine and he is a painter in his spare time. It's all the more intriguing as these paintings seem to come from the prehistoric times. Following this reasoning, one could argue that the bearded giant ( Jean Reno) embodies evil and a threat to the efforts deployed by the man and the doctor to regain what finally made a human being. Ditto for the gang of baddies at the beginning of the film. The pessimistic whiff that such a film could convey isn't really at the fore and gives way to a glimmer of hope. Personally, the film could have gained with no music at all, except the one the man can hear with his cassette recorder. Luc Besson was to make better and still entrancing films like this one, he also boosted Pierre Jolivet's career as a director who will leave a patchy work behind him in the future: "" Force Majeure "" ( 1989), "" Simple Mortel "" ( 1991), "" ma Petite Entreprise "" ( 1999) or "" Filles Uniques "" ( 2003)."

104,"YOU BELONG TO ME ( 1941) is a example of the ' ScrewBall Comedy ' which started in the mid 1930s and ended postwar ( WWII). Some of these films maintained their status. Others have earned undeserved praise when originally were critical and box office flops. Like BRINGING UP BABY ( 1938) or MR. & MRS. SMITH ( 1941). Then there is this one which value just keeps sinking. Why can be rooted in the screenplay/ story. It strains credibility from the get go, betraying a superior cast. Kallimah is married to millionaire HENRY FONDA who is insanely jealous. He would be content to sit back with his million$ and love his , he wishes to maintain his profession as a Doctor.

105,"What Game Over: Kasparov and the Machine does best is to delve into Garry Kasparov's psyche during the 1997 competition against IBM's Deep Blue. You see him becoming more and more paranoid, and increasingly unravelled, all because in the second game, Deep Blue made a move that seemed too human for his preconceived notion of chess computers. Kasparov thought then, and still does, that IBM cheated. Game Over tries to seem unbiased, but it is clear that the director thinks that IBM cheated. However, they give no real evidence to support the cheating claim, only intimations that IBM's security surrounding the computer room was because IBM really had grandmasters hidden in there overriding the computer on certain key occasions, and Kasparov's assertion that the computer didn't play like a computer usually does at one point in game two. In game two, Kasparov played a game that was designed to trick the computer, attempting to sacrifice a pawn in a situation where previous computer chess programs would have taken the pawn, leading to the computer's eventual loss. Deep Blue didn't take the bait, and Kasparov was so rattled because the computer seemed to play like a human that he didn't even see that he could have played Deep Blue to a draw and ended up resigning. That game psyched him out so much that he was unable to recover, and after playing games 3,4, and 5 to draws, lost game 6 horribly. The question of whether IBM cheated all comes down to that single move in game two, where the Deep Blue made the move that any human would make but that had, up to that point, tripped up computers. Joel Benjamin, a chess grandmaster on IBM's programming team explained in the documentary that they knew that chess computers always got tripped up in that situation, and consequently spent a lot of time and effort programming Deep Blue so that it wouldn't make the mistake that other computers do. If you believe Benjamin's assertion, then the case is clear, IBM did not cheat. Unfortunately, the director quickly moved on and never mentioned IBM's explanation for the rest of the movie, preferring to cut between shots of the chess playing hoax of the 19th century, The Turk, and shots of Deep Blue, hinting that Deep Blue was really controlled by a human as well. As someone who has an understanding of programming, the explanation by IBM makes perfect sense -- if you knew what you were doing, it would not be terribly difficult to put something in the code so that, if thus and so conditions are reached, then do thus and so -- in other words, tell the computer what to do if a situation like the one that Kasparov created in game 2 ever happened. This isn't cheating, it's doing a good job of programming a chess computer. In the end, it's eminently clear that the director thinks that IBM cheated, and the repeated comments about IBM's stock rising 15% the day that Deep Blue won suggest the idea that IBM cheated to pump its stock price ( Kasparov even compares IBM and Deep Blue to Enron). However, there is plenty of outside opinion, within both the chess and computer science communities, that Deep Blue won fair and square and that Kasparov lost because he simply couldn't get past his view of computers as "" dumb machines "" and got psyched out by a machine that didn't seem so dumb after all. I just wish that the director had let us see the alternative opinion."

111,"Luc Besson's first work is also his first foray in science fiction, a genre to which he will return fourteen years later with "" the Fifth Element "" ( 1997). Even if this film was strongly influenced by Hollywood cinema, it is still highly enjoyable. Back in 1983, "" le Dernier Combat "" reveals Besson's own approach of science fiction. He takes back a threadbare topic and his efforts are discernible to make a stylish work. Shot in widescreen and black and white, a disaster has destroyed virtually all the population from earth and we will never know what was this disaster and why men can't talk any more.

There are no words in Besson's work. The characters ' actions and the progression of the events go through looks and gestures.

Following this reasoning, one could argue that the bearded giant ( Jean Reno) embodies evil and a threat to the efforts deployed by the man and the doctor to regain what finally made a human being. Ditto for the gang of baddies at the beginning of the film. The pessimistic whiff that such a film could convey isn't really at the fore and gives way to a glimmer of hope.

Neither is it a masterpiece, of course. I approached "" More "" as I did "" Easy Rider "" and Antonioni's "" Blowup "" as a ' timecapsule ' film, a snapshot of an eradespite the differences in pace, style and content between these movies. They all have similar flawseither vague or downright unlikeable characters, acting that seems slightly adrift from reality, relaxed editing, and abrupt endings that have left viewers indignant. These movies never try to be persuasive or meet the audience half waythey are what they are, man. This in itself is not a problem as long as we are left with a souvenir of the experience. Thankfully, "" More "" offers several truly memorable images, sounds and suggestions to the viewer, and this is what saves it. Stefan is a young man who arrives in Paris fresh from his studies in Germany. The first part of the film follows him as he falls in with a group of French hipsters, accompanies them to devastatingly cool and selfconscious parties and bars before meeting Estelle. The two characters become sexually and romantically involved and he promises to follow her to Ibiza, against the advice of his friend Charlie. This is where the Icarus thing comes into playshe is the Sun, he is pursuing her. You may now be able to guess how this all ends. Ibiza is an idyll so far away from the bustling urgency of the overpopulated Paris that the naive Stefan knows he must be on to a good thing. Estelle remains elusive and erratic, and the island has a less desirable underbelly. Up until now I had cared little for either of these characters and their unfocused pursuit of somewhere to be really free, but once the action is pared down to just these two the film becomes poignant quite suddenly. During just one single wistful exchange of dialogue in the remote villa they inhabit, the place where their volatile love crystallises, I went from watching with a fading optimism to being utterly enraptured. I can't think of many other films that have done this. The relationship between Stefan and Estelle is real and human in that we can see it go from lifedefining intimacy to disillusionment and cruel coldness. They take a lot of drugs and cavort naked on the terraces, the rocks and beaches. Their lives revolve around nothing but each other and the beautiful Mediterranean surroundings. For a while, their situation is the very essence of freedom, emotional openness and experience for its own sake. But Stefan is not in control, and this is the downfall of more than just his future on Ibiza. Pink Floyd's score is a perfect fit for the exoticism, the intimacy, and the foreboding of "" More "". It is one of the most memorable inclusions, along with the mosquito netting around Estelle's bed, and their hallucinogenic exuberance around the windmill ( which appears on the soundtrack album's front cover). A scene in which they take acid to escape from heroin withdrawal is illustrative of the fundamental flaws of the couplethey can not ' land ' without a crash. Maybe they've come too close to what they wanted. Stefan never makes contact with any family or friends from before his arrival in Paris. We are left to presume they have no idea where he is. While other 1960s Counterculture movies dwell on debauchery, excess, the media and voyeurism, Schroeder has instead presented us with a story focused upon one man, who backs himself into a little corner somewhere in the world and quietly disappears."

117,"The original Airport ( 1970) was a classic of its kind, and the first two Bmovie followups ( Airport 1975; Airport ' 77) were watchable fun at best, amusing camp at worst; but this crass and inept final entry lacks any entertainment value and displays a shocking contempt for its audience. It's unendurable and not even good for laughs.    All of the three "" Airport "" sequels were theatrical releases made by Universal's television wing but this one is beneath even the modest standards of a TV movie of its day, with cheapjack production, grotesque casting, visual ugliness and tasteless, unfunny "" comedy "". The project was clearly doomed by the "" creative "" efforts of Universal executive Jennings Lang who personally produced and is given a "" story "" credit. Everyone starts somewhere, and writer Eric Roth ( Forrest Gump) might have provided an element of selfburlesque, as had the previous films ( especially the notorious Airport 1975), but there is nothing worth spoofing in Roth's turgid, incoherent script and even the comedy Airplane! left this crud untouched. What makes The Concorde: Airport ' 79 particularly offensive is its insulting misuse of professionals.

120,"Although Humphrey Bogart got star billing in King Of The Underworld, I'm willing to bet he didn't thank Jack Warner for it. In fact this film was one hollow crown. King of the Underworld was supposedly a remake of the Paul Muni film, Dr. Socrates, but given Humphrey Bogart was in the cast, the character is written more like Duke Mantee in The Petrified Forest. He even has an English writer along in the person of James Stephenson. Kay Francis and John Eldredge are a pair of married doctors and Eldredge pulls off a tricky bit of surgery on one of Bogart's henchmen. Bogey's a man who appreciates good work done on his behalf and gives Eldredge$ 500.00 and there's more where that came from if he plays his cards right. Eldredge who has a gambling problem sees a good way to get some undeclared income.    But when he's killed in a raid on the gang's hideout, Francis is also thought to be involved by the law and the American Medical Association no matter how much she protests her innocence. It's no good and she and her aunt Jessie Busley move to a small town to get away from the notoriety. Of course the notoriety and Bogart and an itinerant Leslie Howard like writer in Stephenson all meet up with her again. But Kay is plucky and resourceful to say the least. Bogart's character was ridiculous, no wonder the poor guy was screaming for better parts. He's a gangster who both shoots down people without mercy and gives his henchmen hotfoots just for laughs. He's concerned about his image and therefore kidnaps writer Stephenson to ghost write his autobiography and of course confesses enough to burn him in all 48 states. And then let's Kay Francis completely outsmart him, hard to believe he was king of anything. Definitely one of the lesser works for either of the stars."

123,"Luc Besson's first work is also his first foray in science fiction, a genre to which he will return fourteen years later with "" the Fifth Element "" ( 1997). Even if this film was strongly influenced by Hollywood cinema, it is still highly enjoyable. Back in 1983, "" le Dernier Combat "" reveals Besson's own approach of science fiction. He takes back a threadbare topic and his efforts are discernible to make a stylish work. Shot in widescreen and black and white, a disaster has destroyed virtually all the population from earth and we will never know what was this disaster and why men can't talk any more. Some barbarian hordes were formed. In parallel, a man ( Pierre Jolivet) lives on his own and arrives in an unrecognizable Paris where he is received by a doctor ( Jean Bouise). There are no words in Besson's work. The characters ' actions and the progression of the events go through looks and gestures. Although the starting point and the backdrop are unnerving, the film has never the look of a despondent one. It seems that the man and the doctor try to reproduce gestures and actions linked to mankind before the disaster. The film opens with the man having sex with an inflatable doll. Later, the doctor tries to make him speak through a machine and he is a painter in his spare time. It's all the more intriguing as these paintings seem to come from the prehistoric times. Following this reasoning, one could argue that the bearded giant ( Jean Reno) embodies evil and a threat to the efforts deployed by the man and the doctor to regain what finally made a human being. Ditto for the gang of baddies at the beginning of the film. The pessimistic whiff that such a film could convey isn't really at the fore and gives way to a glimmer of hope. Personally, the film could have gained with no music at all, except the one the man can hear with his cassette recorder. Luc Besson was to make better and still entrancing films like this one, he also boosted Pierre Jolivet's career as a director who will leave a patchy work behind him in the future: "" Force Majeure "" ( 1989), "" Simple Mortel "" ( 1991), "" ma Petite Entreprise "" ( 1999) or "" Filles Uniques "" ( 2003)."

Or maybe you like these blonde, ' ow you say?, bombshells, who are all qualified in aerobics and naked petanques, who decorate my long, maroon velvety sofa like so many soft boiled larks on a plate of pan fried foie gras and figs. You like? You can't have! Zey are all mine. You will never possess ' er as I possessed ' er. Benedetto was the best, apart from Maman. You do not understand the art of lovemaking. Just look at your inferior moustache. It is almost funny to me, non, to think of that ludicrous protuberance on your silly face, as you snuffle around Benedetto 's love hillock like the piggy seeking the truffle in the forest, the forest heaving and swaying in the hot winds of desire! You lose again Sharky. When I make love to the women zey know, Sharky, zey know. Zey learn, zey learn until zey become the teacher. Not nanomaths, the arts of love. Benedetto was the seedling which I watered. I watered his so very often. Everywhere Sharky. His scented petals, his proud stalk, everywhere. He will wither under your ridiculous hose, like the souffl removed from the oven five minute too soon. I must go now Sharky, you bore me so with your disgraceful behaviour. It is you who will be flushed down le pissoir like the smelly thing. Bon chance!"
141,"Luc Besson's first work is also his first foray in science fiction, a genre to which he will return fourteen years later with "" the Fifth Element "" ( 1997). Even if this film was strongly influenced by Hollywood cinema, it is still highly enjoyable. Back in 1983, "" le Dernier Combat "" reveals Besson's own approach of science fiction. He takes back a threadbare topic and his efforts are discernible to make a stylish work. Shot in widescreen and black and white, a disaster has destroyed virtually all the population from earth and we will never know what was this disaster and why men can't talk any more. Some barbarian hordes were formed. In parallel, a man ( Pierre Jolivet) lives on his own and arrives in an unrecognizable Paris where he is received by a doctor ( Jean Bouise). There are no words in Besson's work. The characters ' actions and the progression of the events go through looks and gestures. Although the starting point and the backdrop are unnerving, the film has never the look of a despondent one. It seems that the man and the doctor try to reproduce gestures and actions linked to mankind before the disaster. The film opens with the man having sex with an inflatable doll. Later, the doctor tries to make him speak through a machine and he is a painter in his spare time. It's all the more intriguing as these paintings seem to come from the prehistoric times. Following this reasoning, one could argue that the bearded giant ( Jean Reno) embodies evil and a threat to the efforts deployed by the man and the doctor to regain what finally made a human being. Ditto for the gang of baddies at the beginning of the film. The pessimistic whiff that such a film could convey isn't really at the fore and gives way to a glimmer of hope. Personally, the film could have gained with no music at all, except the one the man can hear with his cassette recorder. Luc Besson was to make better and still entrancing films like this one, he also boosted Pierre Jolivet's career as a director who will leave a patchy work behind him in the future: "" Force Majeure "" ( 1989), "" Simple Mortel "" ( 1991), "" ma Petite Entreprise "" ( 1999) or "" Filles Uniques "" ( 2003)."

147,"Don't watch this movie expecting the Jane Austen wit, crisp dialog or clever social commentary. This time around, the premise of Northanger Abbey has been updated in a very sensual way!    In this version, Catherine's erotic daydreams are not just silly fantasies, but a connection to the world of adult sexuality she is just peeking into with her daylight adventures. By day she is very prim and demure, and her swain Henry treats her with the utmost courtesy. But as her own sexual nature awakens, her daydreams shift every so subtly from mild to steamy to lurid!    At the beginning of the story, Catherine's visions of sex are based entirely on the Gothic novels she devours in bed. It is both heartwarming, sexy, and provocative to observe the way her dreamy picture of handsome Henry "" dissolves "" into a lurid dream of being carried off and ravished by romantic villains! At the same time, it is wry and touching to cut back to her bed in the morning -- Catherine sleeping peacefully looks so innocent one would never guess what really goes on in that pretty little head!    Later, after being invited to Henry's castle, Catherine overhears a family argument and totally misunderstands its meaning. Jumping into bed, she covers herself up with the bedsheets and lies awake listening fearfully, her striking blue eyes the only visible sign that she is alert. Little by little, however, those pretty blue eyes droop and close as she drifts into another heated dream of innocent desire. This time, Catherine dreams she is in Elizabethan times, waiting fearfully outside the castle for the approach of the "" banditi! "" It's pretty clear she is more excited than terrified by the idea of being carried off by bandits. She all but shudders with excitement and anticipation! But then, after a shot of her running frantically to escape, we are back to the daylight world, where the maid is scolding her for having made a mess of her room before falling into a sound sleep. It's worth noting that Catherine's heavyeyed yawning in the morning light is itself a rather sensual symbol of how passionate her dreams have been!    Ultimately, of course, Catherine's stern and unimaginative lover Henry divines the nature of her fantasies and gives her a stern lecture. It's interesting that Catherine's immediate collapse into tears symbolizes not a retreat but an advance into adult relationships. In the next scene, she tearfully burns her Gothic romance and throws herself shamefaced and sobbing onto the bed. Significantly, this turning point is also marked by Catherine falling into a deep sleep -- except that this time, there are no dreams of make believe passion. Presumably, Catherine has matured enough to be ready for the real thing. Though Katherine Schlesinger has lovely blue eyes and a lively expression, and all her performance is charming, it must be said that outside of the heated dream sequences this movie adaptation is excruciatingly dull. I'm giving it 9 stars only because the truly romantic may enjoy it purely on a daydream level. If you'd like to read a book about a genuinely strong willed young heroine who overcomes real darkness and danger in a real Gothic setting, I highly recommend THE PERILOUS GARD by Elizabeth Marie Pope."
