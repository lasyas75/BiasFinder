0,1,"** MAJOR SPOILERS** Watchable only for the action sequences not the story or acting in it "" Nature Unleashed: Fire "" has one of the longest and excruciating endings in modern motion picture history. We have the fearless Ranger Jake, Bryan Genesse, leading this trio of hysterical bikers to safety in of all paces an explosive fume beaching mine shaft! This during a raging forest fire! It seems that Ranger Jake with all his knowledge of the great outdoors didn't realize that a mine shaft that's leaking with dangerous and explosive methane gas is the last place to go when all the woods around it is on fire!*** SPOILERS FROM THIS POINT ON*** All this started some time ago when Ranger Jake in an effort to save the not that on the ball miner Tiny, Chris Harz aka "" The Sherd "", let him slip through his fingers and fall to his death at the bottom of the mine shaft, or did he! Even though we were kept in suspense to who's setting the forest fires for the first half of the movie it wasn't a surprise at all the Tiny was the culprit! As you would expect in movies like these Tiny seemed to be made of hardened steel in that nothing that ever happened to him, fires explosions as well as impaling, could stop the crazed miner. Before Tiny's reappearance, or resurrection, Ranger Jake got involved in rescuing bikers Chris Mel Sharon & Marcus, Josh Cohen Melanie Lewis Anastasia Griffith & Ross McCall, who were trapped in the woods with fires breaking all around them. Having the usual know it allMarcusamong the bikers things don't go as smoothly as Ranger Jake wanted them to go. Marcus not only eggs on the meek Chris to do something stupid, jump with his bike over a 10 foot pile of logs, but has the guy break his leg. This makes it almost impossible for Ranger Jake to have Chris airlifted out before the fires consume him as well as his fellow bikers! For the remainder of the movie Ranger Jake, who put himself in charge, makes boner after boner in his attempt to save himself and the trapped and lost in the woods bikers! All this ends with Jake's brilliant idea to hide in a dangerous and abandoned mine shaft with the rescue party just yards away from rescuing them if they only stayed put and in the open where the rescue team could find them! Even though he was supposed to be the life of the party, or movie, Tiny for all his efforts in being another indestructible super villain came across as a man who spent too much time out in the sun. The makeup job on Tiny was so outrageous that he looked like he dumped a jar of spaghetti sauce over his head instead of having it burned to a crisp. Ranger Jake came across as either somewhat very naive or retarded in his being so taken in by the dangerous Tiny in always trying to save the rampaging psycho who never hid his feelings about what he had in mind for the play by the rules Forest Ranger. In fact Ranger Jake actually encouraged Tiny to do both him and the bikers in by showing him how incompetent he was in trying to save them. The fact that Ranger Jake was successful wasn't because he was so smart but because Tiny, despite his indestructibility, was so brainless!"
1,1,"This is species already hatching into a beautiful model ( Mathilda May). A smashing baby with an urge to kiss and kill! The movie begins with a strong launch, and infected by a borevirus throughout the middle to end. The weakest spot is the presentation of the basic plot/ story. As you should have compared it, Natasha Henstridge's Species got the same plot, but adds up much interesting side plot and not mentioning good actions and strong clymatic ending. This explain why Patrick Stewart joins the fleet of enterprise in Star Trek Next Generation; he wanted to find more models in glass cage, floating inside HalleyComet. A must see for a science fiction fans."
2,1,"Luc Besson's first work is also his first foray in science fiction, a genre to which he will return fourteen years later with "" the Fifth Element "" ( 1997). Even if this film was strongly influenced by Hollywood cinema, it is still highly enjoyable. Back in 1983, "" le Dernier Combat "" reveals Besson's own approach of science fiction. He takes back a threadbare topic and his efforts are discernible to make a stylish work. Shot in widescreen and black and white, a disaster has destroyed virtually all the population from earth and we will never know what was this disaster and why men can't talk any more. Some barbarian hordes were formed. In parallel, a man ( Pierre Jolivet) lives on his own and arrives in an unrecognizable Paris where he is received by a doctor ( Jean Bouise). There are no words in Besson's work. The characters ' actions and the progression of the events go through looks and gestures. Although the starting point and the backdrop are unnerving, the film has never the look of a despondent one. It seems that the man and the doctor try to reproduce gestures and actions linked to mankind before the disaster. The film opens with the man having sex with an inflatable doll. Later, the doctor tries to make him speak through a machine and he is a painter in his spare time. It's all the more intriguing as these paintings seem to come from the prehistoric times. Following this reasoning, one could argue that the bearded giant ( Jean Reno) embodies evil and a threat to the efforts deployed by the man and the doctor to regain what finally made a human being. Ditto for the gang of baddies at the beginning of the film. The pessimistic whiff that such a film could convey isn't really at the fore and gives way to a glimmer of hope. Personally, the film could have gained with no music at all, except the one the man can hear with his cassette recorder. Luc Besson was to make better and still entrancing films like this one, he also boosted Pierre Jolivet's career as a director who will leave a patchy work behind him in the future: "" Force Majeure "" ( 1989), "" Simple Mortel "" ( 1991), "" ma Petite Entreprise "" ( 1999) or "" Filles Uniques "" ( 2003)."
3,1,"In the spirit of the Great Space Coaster, but a few years earlier. Hot Fudge was one of the psychedelic kid's shows that I grew up on. Seymour was a big, fuzzy, green puppet, with a crescent smile of enormous teeth which nearly split his head, I recall him wearing a variety of Elton Johntype shades. He "" played "" piano, and had a Jesus looking dude in a white tux, sitting next to him. They would have a moral discussion and then do a song about it. Don't remember much else except the opening theme, Seymour and the Hippie. No one else I know remembers it at all. I grew up in Jersey, so if it was produced in Detroit as a previous post said, it wasn't just local. Seymour reminded me a lot of Sherlock the Squirrel from the Magic Garden ( another psychedelic kids show if there ever was one.) People always talk about LSD's effects of music and movies of the 70s, but it seems kid's show writers got a dose as well."
4,1,"i did not expect to enjoy this. in truth i watched it because a friend knew a friend knew a friend who wrote the script but wasn't credited. knowing Dylan thomas, and really being appreciative of his poetry but aware and rather disconcerted by the man, i didn't feel i needed to see a twee adaption of his lame bohemian life laid bare. and this was not it. critical and yet appreciative it was. it made me cry. kiera knightley was superb, even with that slightly strained welsh accent, and it is a sad tale that they tell. Dylan thomas is not the hero as sadly he was not throughout his life and neither really are the so called ' feisty woman ' of the pr spiel. it is cillian the william of the movie. a man that leaves the woman he loves to fight a war that they ignore. his challenge to reoonnect with that indifference is what is of real interest to this film and what a beautiful performance from that actor. i thiink this film is underrated because it was marketed so badly. Dylan thomas fans will expect something more from their so very flawed hero and get less, and well that is how it was marketed. it is not a film about Dylan thomas and it is much more interesting for it."
5,1,"Fans of the Pink Panther, Naked Gun, or Get Smart will certainly enjoy this farce that won one Csar and was nominated for four more. Jean Dujardin is Agent OSS 117, a man who wouldn't know a clue if it hit him upside the head. He is also a reflection of the colonialist attitude indicative of the West. All of the Russian spies, Nazis, and Muslim radicals around him are just as stupid, but there is Larmina ( Brnice Bejo) and the Princess ( Aure Atika) to keep things interesting. OSS 117's uncanny ability to pick up languages, play musical instruments the first time he picks them up, and sing like a native are all more impressive than Bond's tricks, but he is still stupid."
6,1,"I remember watching Police Squad! when it first came on ABC in 1982 and I thought it was a very funny show, thanks to the many sight gags, non sequitors and scripts filled with word play. In one episode, there was a line where a man named Once was shot twice.    But unfortunately, ABC canceled the show after only six episodes. I felt it deserved a much longer run but a network executive thought the show demanded too much attention of the viewer because of all the sight gags in each episode. One that I remember was in the opening where the episode's title was different from the one shown on the screen.    Leslie Nielsen's portrayal of Frank Drebin was deadpan, yet very funny and his role was in the narrative style of Jack Webb of Dragnet. Alan North did well and Peter Lupus, in one of his few roles since Mission: Impossible wasn't bad as Norberg, But the one character that stood out was Johnny the Shoeshine Boy, played by William Duell. After giving advice to Drebin, there were cameos from Dick Clark, Dr. Joyce Brothers and then Dodger manager Tommy LaSorda.    Even though Police Squad! had a short life on ABC, the Zucker Brothers didn't give up on the concept which turned out even more successful in the Naked Gun movie franchise. I'll close with a regular closing gag. Freeze the ending right here."
8,1,"A young woman, Jodie Foster, is witnessing a mafia murder, reports the killing to the local police, and becomes herself a hit target by the mob operatives. A professional killer, Dennis Hopper, hired by mafia, is stalking her to prepare for the hit, but eventually he falls for her. Then, as a parody of the Stockholm Syndrome that defines a case when an abducted hostage begins to like and cooperate with the kidnapper, Jodie Foster falls for her abductor too, make love, and both prepare for a getaway. Denis Hopper, the actor, tries to align himself with the creative ambitions of Dennis Hopper, the director. The result is disappointing, and fails to keep pace with the artistic level of a great performer as Dennis Hopper is. There is no real thrill and the script is sometimes naive and predictable. The film is saved to some extent by the performance of Jodie Foster who is not at her best, but still shines with her talent, beauty and gift. Of historical interest is the short appearance of Vincent Price, and, in a small act, of Charlie Sawn known from his great part in "" Wall Street "". If you decide to spend the 116 minutes to see the film, it is not a complete loss; this movie offers easy entertainment, but we would expect much more from the director of "" Easy Rider "", and the actress who gave us the character of Sarah Tobias in "" The Accused ""."
11,1,"I hate it when people in the movie theater talk back to the screen. It's one of the main reasons why I stick to DVD's or videos. I saw The Clearing on DVD but if I had seen it in the movies I would have had to stand up and SCREAM "" HE 'S NOT DEAD YET, YOU MORON! "" The Clearing is another in a long list of horrible movies that feature Mr. Redford. Legal Eagles, Havana, Indecent Proposal, Up Close and Personal, Sneakers, Last Castle, and Spy Game. If Robert Redford told me to invest in something I'd go the other way.    But the worst possible thing you can do to an audience is this. Say you're being kidnapped and your kidnapper has a gun. He's holding it on you for most of the movie. You turn the tables on him and start strangling him. Whatever you do keep strangling him until he's DEAD! Don't just strangle him for ten seconds. Stay with it! Ten minutes at least. But Bob stops too soon, walks away and forgets about Mr. Kidnapper until ....... He gets up, finds the gun and holds it on our hero again. At this point I wanted Mr. Kidnapper to shoot Robert Redford. More than a few times. And I wanted to shoot him as well."
12,1,"Um, hello .. Rainbow Brite .. the name alone is hard to take it seriously, like she could be the cousin of Strawberry Shortcake .. but when you're a kid, this is definitely serious stuff. So, there's this vile, snotty, spoiled girl and she wants Rainbow Brites belt, amongst other things, ie the light of the whole universe, and Rainbow Brite and her friend Cris are bound and determined to stop her. As I remember, Murky and Lurky had a minor role in this production. Maybe they wanted too much money? So anyway, snotty, evil girl has a powerful jewel and she channels it's power to take Rainbow's belt .. imagine? But somehow, Rainbow gets her belt back and reenergizes it with "" star sprinkles "" and kicks the bad girls ' butt with the help of Cris and his prism bracelet, and they also save the whole universe in the process. So good triumphs over evil, niceness triumphs over rudeness, and Rainbow Brite and the Color Kids are once again safe to spread color and joy for all mankind."
15,1,"What is he supposed to be? He was a kid in the past, ... and the future? This movie had a lot of problems. Is he a ghost, or just a strong kid. Man, ... what a piece of crap. I'm still confused. Also, is he supposed to be an abortion? Strange. Very strange. This movie will mess with your mind, ... and it's not very scary, ... just confusing. Why was he, ... Where did, ... What was the, ... oh, who cares, ... Milo isn't worth it, ... My score: 10"
16,1,"I pretty much liked every character on this show from the start except Reba herself. She comes off as an holier than thou type and quite frankly a big Bully. And that stinks because she is in every scene and every episode. In the later seasons Van becomes unlikeable too, like a spoof of his former self. and Kyra walks around sneering and being miserable. The first 3 to 4 seasons are pretty good if you overlook Reba. Towards the end its pretty bleak .. In basically every episode Barbara jean Is walking around being dumb, Reba is being mean to her, but poor Ole Barbara jean desperately wants Reba to like her which results in Barabara jean telling Reba how awesome she is in every episode. I think it is pretty clear to see Reba has self esteem issues and wants to be seen as this all forgiving saint. Its really a shame too because other than her the show had such potential."
17,1,"It is hard for a lover of the novel Northanger Abbey to sit through this BBC adaptation and to keep from throwing objects at the TV screenin fact, if Jane Austen herself were to see this, she would be somewhat amused and possibly put out. Maggie Wadey's adaptation has made Northanger Abbey into what it satirized, the Gothic novel ( and the readers of Gothic novels). The role of Catherine Morland in the adaptation is portrayed fairly closely to Austen's Catherine, a openhearted, generous girl whose imagination simply runs away with her. But the Henry Tilney of the novel is not a snufftaking, canewielding, sappylinemaking hero of a Gothic novelhe is a tease, a nearlyhandsome man with a messy room and a living ( that's right, Henry Tilney is a clergyman, a charm that is completely dropped from the script). Some of the best scenes from novel, when Henry, completely deadpan, outrageously teases the literallyminded Catherine on diction, journals, Mrs. Radcliffe, etc., are not portrayed in the adaptation. A large section of Henry's personality is lost when those scenes are not adapted. Besides, Peter Firth's appearance is not accurateHenry Tilney is supposed to be 24 or 25, dark hair and a brown skin, not 35 or 40 and blond. There are so many other absurdities within the adaptation that invoke surprise and disgustwho is the Marchioness, and what is she doing in the story?! Why is John Thorpe less of a dunce and more of a schemer? Why is Northanger Abbey a castle? Catherine of the novel, with her romantic visions, expects hidden passages and dark tapestries, but is very disappointed to discover that Northanger Abbey is actually a comfortable, modern houseanother element of satire! Why portray General Tilney as a drunk? Why does Catherine have those strange visions of Mrs. Allen threading her finger, etc.? Catherine's imagination only runs away with her at Northanger, with Henry there to correct her gently. And lastly, why are so many facts concerning the Tilney family and Mrs. Tilney's death altered unnecessarily? To make the story more` horrible? ' All of these oddities and more simply are too strange to be overlooked.  >"
18,1,"I've read approximately 10 reviews of this film, but haven't taken any of them "" to heart "". Harrison Ford is being criticized for everything from his haircut to his earring and I really don't see what any of these things have to do with the film. As I recall, he had bad hair plus bad reviews in Blade Runner but it's still a favorite among us videophiles. It is slower than the majority of his previous films but not worthy of the trashings it has received. I would gladly pay$ 7.50 just to watch a bald Harrison Ford mow his lawn."
19,1,"This movie was strange mainly because the plot was so incoherent. The title refers to a vicious wind which renders the surface of the earth almost uninhabitable when it blows, but this seemed to have nothing whatsoever to do with what was going on. The movie seems to be an extremely poor ripoff of Bladerunner ie rogue android being chased by bounty hunter(or ruthless cop in this). Luke Skywalker turns in a surprisingly good performance as aforementioned rogue cop. Nothing seems to be resolved at the end of the movie, we never find out anything of any substance about the android or what his intentions are. There is one baffling scene where Bill Paxton(who has kidnapped the android) plays one particular song in his cardboard airplane for no particular reason(the song is called "" Shape of things "", by The Yardbirds). This happens again in a later scene where the same song is played for no apparent reason. Does this song have any relevance to the movie? Don't think so."
21,1,"Ugly, heartless Hollywood crap that expects nothing but ugliness and heartlessness from its audience. The scenes WITHOUT Spacey reveal how truly awful the film really is. But the scenes WITH Spacey are just so entertaining that you hang on in there right to the end. Yes, he could play this part in his sleep but he does it so well, he's such a joy to watch, so believable and marvellously monstrous. Enjoy it for his performance, but don't expect anything else from this movie. If you want to see a great film about the evils of modern Hollywood, check out Robert Altman's "" The Player "". This sad little potboiler is not remotely in the same league."
24,1,"I can understand why others reacted rather unpleasantly towards the climax yielding a twist that really is hard to take seriously. I think, though, that the buildup to it works rather well. The music, quite menacing and spinetingling, really provides a spooky aura matching the unforgiving sound of a constant ringing telephone that is driving struggling English actress, Joan Matlin(Jean Marsh)bonkers. She's borrowing a pal's nice apartment while attempting to jumpstart her career in New York City ( .. the city buildings outside the window look about as realistic as David Letterman's)and is unceremoniously welcome by a noisy telephone which rings quite a bit, followed by loud slams against the wall. Searching for answers regarding the one responsible for such disregard towards her sanity, Joan discovers that no one rents that room, and that a former tenant had in fact strangled herself. Without help from the manager, Joan will decide to find out for herself who is causing her such anguish. Joan discovers the room empty and the phone with a particular female voice which will haunt her. The episode, I think, is a tourdeforce for Jean Marsh who is a one woman show. She's the only actress visible and we follow her through the crisis which slowly erodes her, the phone and the banging from that other room causing her much distress which grows into fear. Instead of leaving, Joan remains, so shaken by the noise and to the breaking point where she just wishes for the phone ( .. or whoever is ringing)to stop. The episode provides a possible answer as to who is plaguing Joan and why. A character named Beth comes into the story rather late as Joan struggles to find out whose female voice it was across the other line who knew her name on that dreaded phone she discovers in the room across from hers. The fate of Beth might just tell the viewer why Joan is being traumatized. I think this episode is an exercise in spooks instead of credibility;some didn't particularly like it, but I certainly did. I will admit that the phone, as a physical menace "" crawling "" towards Joan is hard to take seriously, not to mention it's attack on her, but I thought the intense opening twenty minutes before this were suitably chilling enough to make up for it."
25,1,"The Deer Hunter's success with critics and publics alike led United Artists to give Cimino carteblanche on "" Heaven's Gate, "" an epic Western about the 1892 Johnson County Wars     The elliptical story, about the persecution of lowly Europeanborn farmers by Wyoming's cattlebarons, was a muddled mixture of classconflict, sumptuous pageant and underwritten, stereotypical characters    However, Cimino's fetish for authenticity and his sweeping sense of scale ensured that the film running at nearly four hours    was rarely tedious     Its undeserved status as a cause clbre, with critics divided as to whether it was a masterpiece or a fiasco, derived from its inflated budget    Blamed for the studio's financial problems, Cimino became a scapegoat for Hollywood's general decline, and the film, edited into an incomprehensible short version after its initial release, was a commercial disaster"
26,1,"That distinction has to go to THE DUNGEON OF HARROW. At least Ed Wood's misguided attempt at making a quality science fiction film had the dubious "" star "" power of Bela Lugusi, Vampira, Tor Johnson, Criswell and Lyle Talbot. THE DUNGEON OF HARROW has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. What could have been an interesting and suspenseful plot about a marooned aristocrat on a leper colony, perhaps in the style of THE ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU or MYSTERIOUS ISLAND, is trashed by the heavy dialog and mono tonal acting of amateurs whose lines sink like lead weights into a sea of stupidity. The "" special effects "", which took place in someone's bathtub, further doom this film to the dung heap. Even the treatment of leprosy is something out of a Victorian interpretation of the Bible. The fact that leprosy can not be contracted from an individual in its last stages belies the plot line that the aristocrat Fallon and his lady, Cassandra contract the disease and end up as the original occupants of the Castle De Sade, doomed to insanity and inhuman cruelty. It is interesting to note that not one member of the cast made another film. No wonder, talent begets talent; lack of talent begets oblivion, which is where this film should find its deplorable end."
27,1,"The Box is a film with great potential, but the makers totally misused that potential. The film seemed to take for ever, because of the boring family dinners and scenes about school and jobdialogs between the action. Those scenes could and must be deleted in my opinion to keep up the tensity and thrill. The philosophy of human free will has potential and seems to referring to the philosophy of Thomas Hobbes ( 15881679), but we find ourselves regretfully struck with magic and nosebleeds, were even Harry Potter would flunked his class with! Probably the best part was that moment when Norma Lewis ( Cameron Diaz)has been shot to death, by her loving and caring husband as an act of human free will. I wonder how Hobbes would react if he could ..."
29,1,"Jack Webb finally gives something besides his usual wooden indian performance. He played the epitome of the jarhead, brainwashed, storm the beaches, semper fi, bonehead military idiot. The Corps before all else, even humanity. This great film showed the idiosy of boot camp to it's fullest. 4 stars."
30,1,"Curse of Michael Myers is a very frustrating piece to deal with for a fan of the Halloween series. After a very disappointing letdown in Halloween 5, the series reached a near ebb in plot lines, with a silly devolution into witchcraft and a teenage cult dedicated to the worship of Michael Myers. "" Curse of Michael Myers "" ups the ante in blood and gore, but really represents a decay in the series ' integrity. It's too bad to, as this is the last movie for Donald Pleasance as the character of Dr. Loomis. Pleasance has some good screen moments ( precious ones if your a fan of the series) as the now very aged and as he says "" very retired doctor "". Sadly he died before the movie was completed, and it is very apparent at the conclusion of the film that the stories original climatic scene was never realized. Right from the beginning credits, Halloween 6 has more of the feel of a madeforTV movie then that of the blockbuster horror flick that it started out as in 1978. Any loyal Halloween alumni should have demanded more from this film, ... Dr. Loomis and Donald Pleasance deserved more."
31,1,"To be brief, the story is paper thin and you can see the ending coming from a mile away, but Gene Kelly, Rita Hayworth, and an impossibly young Phil Silvers keep the movie afloat throughout and at times lift it right up into the air. A few of the songs are terrible clunkers ( "" Poor John "" is a train wreck) but most of them are great fun, and the scene of Hayworth performing on the absurdly huge set for Kelly's rival has to be seen to be believed. Another treat is the perfect fauxNYC sets in the best Hollywood tradition. Another attraction, if you consider such things attractions, is the howlingly awful male "" chivalry "" toward women. The oily leering and transparent obsequiousness that passed for male charm back then ( in the movies, at least) is presented in its most lurid form here. Some of the men are about like a cartoon wolf. One minor disappointment is Eve Arden trapped in a role so minor that she barely has a chance to do anything. I can imagine a lot of potential comic interplay between her and Silvers -- a missed opportunity."
33,1,"I rented this movie, because I noticed the cover in the video rental store. I saw Nolte, Connely, Madsen, 40's time setting, and thought "" hmm, can't be too bad. "" Unfortunately, after watching it, my impression was "" not too good "". Its kind of a Chinatown ripoff, but the worst part is that other than Nolte, the other members of the squad didn't get enough screen time. But its a decent movie to see once I guess. And Melanie's role was small enough that she wasn't given a chance to be a nuisance."
34,1,"Not even original in the plot. Ho hum. There were a couple of angles that could have been quite interesting, but the film follows the path of 90% of Hollywood movies. I don't really "" get "" Samuel Jackson's acting most of the time in his other films, but he was rather good in this film. He rarely yelled and went much further in his character rather than reverting to an "" in your face anger. "" I liked Eva Mendesas usualand even though she is great eye candy, she proves herself to be much more than that as an actress. Luis Guzman was actually really good also, except that I disliked the change of his character towards Samuel Jackson at the end of the film. How can one's character center around a dislike for a former cop and then turn into lollipop land within a split second? Is there no original thought left in Hollywood?"
35,1,"While everyone does a decent job in this film, I agree with the other comment: it's too loose and scattered, too much like a scriptless experiment with really talented actors. As such, it isn't enough to hold your attention. Having said that, there are a few really funny moments, one involving Dylan McDermott and a flaming shot glass that I think anyone who's been that drunk would find as funny as I did; the other is a splitsecond with an inflatable dinosaur. Crispin Glover does his usual nutty twitchfest guy and does it fine, Harry Dean Stanton does his usual nutty patriarch ( Repo Man, anyone?) etc. Good cast, not enough to keep it going. Just a few gems, seconds long."
38,1,"I did not think Haggard was the funniest movie of all time I like CKY and Viva La Bam a lot more. I think a lot of it was just really stupid and had no plot for being a movie. I highly recommend not paying a lot of money for this movie but anyone who likes viva la bam, CKY, or Jack Ass should see it. I loved many parts of the movie and then there were parts that should have been cut out. I think that Jonny Knoxville should have played in the movie because he is a much better actor then most of the people from Haggard and probably could have made this movie allot more funnier. I think Ryan Dunn was probably the best actor and it should have had bam skating more."
39,1,"Although it strays away from the book a little, you can't help but love the atmospheric music and settings. The scenes in Bath are just how they should be. Although if you have watched it as many times as I have you notice that the background people are the same in each scene, but that aside, I like the scene where they are in the Hot Baths, but did the men and women really bathe together like that? You could see all the men perched around the outside leering at the women. It also seemed strange that they all had their hats on, but perhaps this was the style at the time. The ballroom scenes were very nice, the dancing and the outfits looked beautiful. I especially liked Catherine's dress in the first ballroom scene. Northanger Abbey looked suitably imposing, but I enjoyed the Bath scenes better. Schlesinger gives a good but not exceptional performance as Catherine Morland. Googie Withers gives the best performance as Mrs Allen I feel. Ugh Peter Firth as Mr Tilney, he just talks a load of rubbish, and is not a clergyman as he should be, it's hard to think of him being in love with Catherine, but then the book never really gave that impression either. General Tilney is played reasonably well by Hardy, and Stuart also gives a sort of good performance as Isabella. Ingrid Lacey did not give a good performance as Elinor Tilney. As for John Thorpe, well he gives the impression of a seedy and lustful man, perhaps not the character portrayed in the book, but I quite like it. I can handle scenes being cut from a book adaptation, but when new scenes and characters are added it usually annoys me. The marchioness! I hate her. She is not part of the Northanger story and neither is her cartwheeling page boy. some of the script is peculiar. When Catherine is asking Elinor Tilney about her Mothers death she asks "" I suppose you saw the body? How did it appear? "" What a silly thing to say! Elinor's calm response is stupid too. anyway please tell me if you agree or disagree with me"
40,1,"It pains me to see an awesome movie turn into some lame, repetitive and lazy series. It is filled with plot holes and the plot is confusing, in a BAD way. Whoever the prick writers were that decided to turn such a great movie into this garbage should have done some research, instead of filling it with oneliners and hollow new characters, and the classic jokes from the first movie OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN. Sure they get a little creative, but its like seeing the same episode with a small twist. Pretty much like listening to Creed, or Nickleback. Kuzco has to prevent himself from failing, Yzma has a complicated plan, but decides to go the easy way to save time and just use a potion, someone questions the monkey and the bug, Bucky appears in the background, Kuzco flirts with Malina, she disses him without sounding like a bitch, Yzma disguises herself as "" Principal Amzy "" and she calls Kronk, and he forgets that she is Yzma. I admit, this show does have it's moments. Another problem is the fact that Yzma looks younger and Pacha looks .... weird. Also, no one can replace David Spade and John Goodman! Their the ones who made Kuzco and Pacha Kuzco and Pacha! Sorry, but i give this show two thumbs down."
41,1,"I was quite impressed with this movie as a child of eight or nine. The gangsters seemed very real and threatening to me, and I could see why people would have been afraid of someone like Dillinger. Seeing it as an adult, it seemed almost comical, owing to the overdone narration and jarring details like Thirties gangsters driving cars that looked like they were from the Fifties. There is a certain gritty, unglamorous reality to the way the criminals are portrayed, but the overall effect is more like a bad soap opera. The most memorable and most unintentionally funny bit that sticks with me is the scene where Ma Barker and her sons are shooting it out with the FBI and the sons are killed. The narrator says something like "" Perhaps in that moment, for the only time in her life, Ma Barker became a real mother "". This is meant to be a moment of great tragedy and pathos, as Ma finally realizes how she's destroyed her family out of her own greed, but instead, it provokes laughter. A very odd film that is rarely shown anywhere these days. Gangster movie buffs might enjoy it, but more as a curiosity than a real movie."
42,1,"The movie has started, the wheels spin, your car has entered a race against the Fox .... You're behind you can't get in front, you figure, "" if i go out, i'm taking you with me ...

44,1,"I rarely give ratings less than 5, but in this instance I must weigh in. Elmore Leonard is a great writer with many wonderful, complex books, original characters, crisp dialogue, invigorating plot twists. Films based on his books go way back to Hombre ( Paul Newman), Mr. Majestyk ( Bronson), and Out of Sight ( Clooney/ Lopez) among others. Even when done soso the films at least have some measure of story essence coming through. This one, .... it is simply not a worthy addition to the catalog. The acting is bad ( I do not know why, because these are very capable people here) and the story is handled with stupidity. The characters are rearranged, the chemistry is missing, the actors and actresses are miscast. Since Elmore Leonard is a really great story teller, I would hope that anyone who does not know his work would be dissuaded from reading his books because they saw this disappointing rendition of one of his stories. The story is a sequel to Get Shorty. If you have not seen that film, do not watch this. If you have seen Get Shorty, do not proceed to this. I saw Be Cool a few years back, and tonight have been revisiting the vid. The first time must not have made such a negative impression because I had forgotten how dismal this sequel was. Fortunately, I think no less of those who appeared in this film for having done so. They probably expected something more. Get Shorty was original and great fun. Travolta I nearly always like, but he is so much better in Tarantino's Pulp Fiction and in the preceding Get Shorty. He was clearly unable to enjoy whatever was going on here. And I hear Freaky Deaky, another Elmore Leonard book, is in preproduction for 2008 release. Hopefully they can pull it off. Read the books. They are almost all great."
47,1,"This is the type of film that makes you question your past admiration for a particular director before you stop and remind yourself that there are very few people whose body of work doesn't contain a few clunkers. The casting in Lelouch's films is of utmost importance because he puts the viewer into such intimacy with the characters. The actors have to bring real screen magic to live up to the intensity. Otherwise it is just hollow.    None of the actors in this film had any of that screen magic, in my opinion. Jeremy Irons and Patricia Kaas fell far short as the leads. Irons is a talented actor but he was wrong for this part. Lovable rogue didn't suit his strengths. His brand of charm also hit a false note for me here. Iron's persona is too decadencetinged to fit into a Lelouch love story. Although I would hesitate to pass up any opportunity to hear an English accent, I also think an American actor would have worked better in this role. So many of the songs that Kaas sings are so closely identified with the Americanness of the particular lyricist that it seemed kind of discordant to then have Jeremy Irons playing the love interest -- even though logically it really didn't matter. It still screwed up the flow of the movie somehow. At least for me. Of course, it would have had to have been the right American. I think George Clooney would have been great in the part. And he would have brought the screen magic in spades. Brad Pitt could also have done a really good job delivering his particular combination of charming and edgy. I was also very disappointed with Patricia Kaas. In reading about her, I've learned that she has a hugely successful career as a singer and many fans, so what do I know, but I found her screen presence as a singer very boring. She was actually a much better actress in her speaking scenes than she was a singer in those scenes in which she had to interpret and sell a song. Nothing she sang moved me. She was pleasant but bland. In contrast, someone like Kate Hudson, who is not a professional singer and has only voicecoach French still would have handled this part a million times better. Not to mention all that stunning French talent out there that could have been tapped into. It was wrenching watching Patricia Kaas take up screen space when there are so many charismatic French actresses who could have been cast instead.    The music was so important in this film, it could not really work without the music working. And since Kaas delivered so poorly in this respect, the movie never really had a chance. Lelouch sealed the fate of this movie when he cast Patricia Kaas. JMO."
50,1,"Joan Fontaine is swept off her feet by the suave Cary Grant. After their marriage, she realizes that her husband is very irresponsible and owes a major gambling debt. It appears that Grant tries to scheme his best friend, Nigel Bruce, out of part of his life savings. Bruce ends up murdered and Fontaine suspects that her husband will try to kill her for the insurance money. This drama drags on to an abrupt and flat finale."
51,1,"The first thing you should know about "" Zipperface "" is that it was shot on video, so it has that peculiar "" homevideoish "" look that is terribly distracting and makes it hard to take this seriously as a "" real "" film. And "" Zipperface "" indeed looks as if a bunch of amateurs got together for an attempt at a "" real "" serialkiller thriller. It's not quite that, but it's not as bad as it looks, either. Having a woman as one of the two detectives on the case puts a spin on the exploitation genre. Dona Adams gives an appealingly amateurish performance in the roleher obvious inexperience in front of the camera somehow works for her. Plus, she puts up a GREAT fight against the killer at the end. The red herrings appear ludicrous at first, but ultimately they workI guessed the killer INcorrectly. And you have to wonder if perhaps Tarantino had seen the Zipperface guy when he came up with the idea of "" The Gimp "" for "" Pulp Fiction "". (* 1/2)"
52,1,"Every movie Quentin Tarantino has made has become progressively worse. I'd like to believe that most people would agree with that statement, but seeing as "" Inglourious(sic) Basterds(sic) "" has an 8.5/10 from over 100,000 ratings, it doesn't seem like the general moviegoing public has any sense. Even his best work, Reservoir Dogs, wasn't a ' masterpiece. ' The trouble is that claiming that you like Tarantino's work has become trendy. As soon as that happens, you get boatloads of people ready and willing to hop on another bandwagon. They will ignore laughably terrible acting, and utterly selfindulgent writing just so they can be part of the exclusive club called "" everyone. "" This movie is so terrible, that I swear it must be some sort of twisted joke by Tarantino to see how much torture his fans will tolerate and still praise him. Like another reviewer has already said: "" Previous Tarantino movies were from a guy in love with other movies. This one is from a guy in love with his own writing. "" I couldn't agree more. This movie is nothing more than selfindulgent and injoke riddled writing paired with acting ability taken right out of a high school play. But, thanks to the general movie going public, I'm sure it will still go down as one of the best movies ever made. Bravo, Tarantino. You've pulledoff one of the best practical jokes of all time."
53,1,"This movie was a dismal attempt at recreating a crucial time in English history. The film version of Cromwell's growing involvement in the War is marginally accurate but the overall historical accuracy of this movie was way off. This film implies that the war was started over religious differences but the Civil War was in no way Catholic versus Protestant: both sides were Protestant. Cromwell was never present at the battle of Edgehill, nor did he ever "" save the day "". The royalists did not win, the battle ended in a draw. As another reviewer has noted, Cromwell was certainly not one of the "" Five Members "" who were to be removed from the House and arrested.    Overall, this movie was decent. The producers tried WAY to hard and it didn't turn out so great.    definitely could have been better."

Watch Dolemite as he and his army of allfemale kung fu killers take down Mr. Big and Willie Green. Awesome plot, huh? There are so many oneliners that multiple viewings are necessary to improve your vocabulary. If you say a couple of lines from Dolemite, you are instantly cool.

60,1,"You know you're watching softcore with the wrong attitude when the poor dubbing bothers you. I'm okay with the crappy lip syncing but the sound mix is really of too. Every time someone says anything it sounds like there's a narrator. Either way, this is pretty much the purgatory between boring French professionalism and the heavenly campy Joe D'Amato flicks involving cannibalism and whatnot. Don't get me wrong, there's a fair dose of exploitation in this one, but there's always room for more. Laura Gemser stars, and that's good because she's hot. It's a bit freaky how at times you can see her bone structure, but she still rules over her white counterpart. You can also make a cool drinking game of how often she takes her kit of. Often. Every reason is good. Every person is good. Every location is good. One scene even involves an entire hockey team, whatever they are doing in Africa. Sometimes the plot gets in the way, and the supporting cast consists of some really vile looking people, but there's enough Laura Gemser for all."
62,1,"This film is about two horse traders who agree to escort a small group of Mormons across the desert. Along the way, they encounter a murderous family of thugs who menace the peaceful folks and put their pilgrimage in jeopardy. WAGON MASTER is what I would term a "" little "" John Ford film, as it obviously did not have the budget or scope of some of his other Westerns. In particular, this film lacks the bigname stars like John Wayne but allows some of the usual supporting characters to take center stage. Longtime Ford stock character actors Ben Johnson, Harry Carey, Jr. and Ward Bond have been elevated to starring roles and perhaps the one who came of as "" the "" lead was probably Johnson -- though the other two got nearly as much screen time and focus. This is not a bad thing, as the film worked just fine without the big star -- and is well worth seeing. Now this isn't to say I loved the movie. It was very good but certainly not perfect. In particular, as far as the music goes, you'll probably either love it or hate it. I found the Sons of the Pioneers ' music a bit schmaltzy at times. It did evoke a nice mood, but seemed to occasionally dominate the scenes. I think a little would have worked much better. Plus, with their incessant singing in the background, I kept expecting Roy Rogers to pop out at any moment. Another minor problem is that the plot was amazingly simple and the ending was pretty much a foregone conclusion. However, and I am glad to say there is a ' however ', despite this being rather formulaic and sentimental, the film still worked well. This was primarily due to John Ford's nice, as usual, direction as well as Ben Johnson's exceptional performance. He was able to provide an excellent anchor for the film. Another plus for me is that I saw this in the same week as BRIGHAM YOUNG, another film about the Mormon migration. While BRIGHAM YOUNG was a bit silly and overly "" saintly "" in its portrayals, here the Mormons were less "" perfect "" and more like real people -- with foibles and personalities. Oh, and speaking of BRIGHAM YOUNG, it seems as if Jane Darwell was the ' go to ' girl for Mormonthemed films during this era, as she was a major supporting character in both films. Considering that she died in BRIGHAM YOUNG and it was set about 20 years before WAGON MASTER, this is some stunt! Also, if you'd like to catch a glimpse of the famous Jim Thorpe, he's in a tiny role where he plays the impassive Indian dancing next to Jane Darwell around the camp fire."
64,1,"Well, how to start? I saw The Italian Job for the first time some years ago and visiting a rental shop I couldn't quite remember why I had a bad feeling about it. Now I do. After voting for the ratings for this film I saw the statistics. Apparently this film appeals most to under 18 girls. No wonder. They didn't pay enough to Charlize to flash and I guess some girls magazine has rated Mark Wahlbergs abs "" AWESOME "". Other than that this film is completely predictable, the actors are mainly forever Bstars and even the good ones are being misused horribly, the film is filled with obvious product placement and imagine this: it even manages to repeat itself without doing a sequel! The first 15 minutes are the best part of the film and it's all downhill from there and once they figured this out they decided to use the finest hour again in the end repeatingtodetail their gold heist. All in all, lots of noise about nothing. I think Charlize Theron is good and Ed Norton could be more as he's been before. Apart from Donald Sutherland's "" look, I'm here too "" appearing in the beginning I'd say this movie ought to have a "" pass if you're above 18 "" all over it."
65,1,"Maybe, like most others who have seen this film long after it's premiere on television, I wanted to see many of my favorite actors in old and obscure form, which is exactly what ' Slow Burn ' is. Except, aside from the nostalgic value, the movie itself is not very good. Eric Roberts plays former reporter Jacob Ash, hired by a Gerald McMurty ( Raymond J. Barry), a rich artist, to investigate the whereabouts of his estranged son, Brian, who had been living with his mother, Laine ( Beverly D'Angelo) for the past few years. In a Phillip Marloweesquire fashion Jacob Ash narrates what would become more than just an investigation into the whereabouts of Brian. But, once Jacob tracks down Laine, his discoveries break open wide a whole lot of trouble. Perhaps because events in the film move too slowly, there is never much suspense to this little thriller, not even by the end with the finale routine of revealing the culprits and their motives. However, as said before, this movie is probably one that will draw attention for it's thenrelatively unknown cast of actors, which include both a very young Eric Roberts as well as the adorable Johnny Depp, who plays Laine's stepson, Donnie. That may be reason enough to give it a try ... if you can find it."
67,1,"It's a kinder, gentler Cyborg movie with a love story. Awww. It's not as bad as it sounds. The action, when it is there, is decent and Jack Palance, Elias Koteas, and Angelina Jolie are always dependable. It's the fact that this is a sequel to the terrible Jean Claude Van Damme film, or is that the capper to the Masters of the Universe trilogy? I'm still confused about that. Either way, there was really no need for this movie. What was there a need for? Angelina Jolie. She may play an assassin robot that can explodes midcoitus, but, what a way to go and even though this is her first movie, she still has the presence that made her an award winner."
70,1,"After seeing the film version of Heart Of Darkness, I feel as if I wasted 100 minutes of my life. Though the book was not my favorite, I was very disappointed to see how poorly Nicolas Roeg portrayed the story. Despite the fact that he left out many bits of important information, the cast just did not seem to fit their roles and the whole film seemed vastly emotionless. The book depicts vivid scenery and detail that are completely disregarded in the movie.    You'd think a director would be able to fit 76 pages of a book into a film of at least an hour and a half. The differences completely changed the story for me. For example, when the character of Kurtz's fiance is nonchalant to the fact that Kurtz has died, it completely modifies the ending the book had given. Not to mention the sets and scenery used in the film were not nearly as beautiful as they were described. It sincerely feels as if Roeg was filming another story with references from Heart Of Darkness embedded in it.    If you watch the movie without knowing the title or expecting it to be anything like Joseph Conrad's tale, you may find it good. Though I thought the camera work was poor and the cast unfitting, it is a captivating story all the same. However, if you are looking for a good movie version of the famous classic story, don't look for it in Roeg's film."
73,1,"I usually really like Lawrence and being in Australia I haven't seen much of his stand up, so when I saw this at my video shop I thought, yeah I'll have a look. I wish I hadn't seen it now. Obviously Lawrence had a profound experience that opened up his mind, and I guess he wants to share this with others but this was neither the time nor the place. This whole experience seemed like a motivational speech in hell, it really did. I believe the catch phrase of the night was "" ride it until the wheels fall off "" which he intermingled with just plain lewd jokes revolving around sex and sexual organs. Don't get me wrong, I don't mind crude humor, but Lawrence lacks the gift of classing it up in the fashion of Eddie Murphy, Richard Prior or Robin Williams. Lawrence was just plain lewd, the only time I laughed was when he relived his experience with the law and his recovery in the hospital. If there were minus points, i would give them ...."
77,1,"Earth has been destroyed in a nuclear holocaust. Well, parts of the Earth, because somewhere in Italy, a band of purebred survivors -- those without radioactive contamination -- are holed up in a massive mansion surrounded by lush grounds, waiting for the next opportunity to go hunting for those with polluted blood. The Final Executioner is the story of one of their would be victims, Alan ( William Mang, who looks, not surprisingly, a lot like Kurt Russell), and his efforts to take down the legally sanctioned hunters, who are led by Edra ( Marina Costa) and Erasmus ( Harrison Muller Jr.). Alan has been trained to kill by former NYPD cop Sam ( Woody Strode) who mostly hangs around giving his pupil moral support and mooching for tinned meat. Strode is by far the best thing about the film, though he doesn't look at all well and only appears for about a third of the running time. As for the story, it's a blending of elements from better films and stories, including Ten Little Indians, The Most Dangerous Game, and Escape From New York. The Final Executioner moves along at a fair pace and provides reasonable entertainment for less discriminate action fans."
79,1,"I can hardly call this a great film but it is entertaining. In my case I, at the time this film was released, was the same age as some of the junior campers in the film. For me watching this film brings back the memories of my camp years. While some of the pranks that takes place in this movie, like carrying the camp director out in his bed and leaving him on the side of a road, strung up in the trees or out on a lake, are a bit over the top some of the other pranks are not. When I went to camp the campers and counselors pulled similar stunts such as running underwear up the flag pole, canoe battles and boys raiding the girls cabin. As I grew older I realized these night raids to the girls cabin that I participated in were carefully orchestrated by the counselors so that we wouldn't find the girls in embarrassing situations but at the time I thought it was real and it was fun. That's what MEATBALLS ( MB) is.    MB captures not only the scenic beauty of camp surroundings but the beauty of being young and carefree. MB give a great example of preteens, teens and young adults living their summer with no concerns other than guys hooking up with girls and girls hooking up with guys and booth having as much fun as they can before they head back to junior high & high school and college. The opening title song that goes "" Are you ready for the summer? ... no more homework no more books, no more teachers dirty looks ... "" describes exactly how summer is viewed by school kids.    I personally enjoyed the two campers Spaz and Fink. What boy, nerd or jock, didn't spend all camp trying to cozy up to some pretty girl camper? What guy didn't want to be accepted by the other campers and counselors? While these two characters are somewhat over the top I bet everybody who watches the film can't help but to like these two guys. These two characters are a mix of Charlie Brown from PEANUTS and Jack Tripper & Larry Dallas from THREE 'S COMPANY. I would bet that most viewers even cheer for Spaz in the egg carrying competition and for Fink as he attempts to "" beat the stomach "" in the hot dog eating contest.    Lastly, this movie had normal looking kids and counselors. No super models for counselors or campers that wore trendy clothing. It is fun to just kick back and watch this film and remember when life was as fun as this movie."
80,1,"Ok, so I saw this movie at this year's Sundance, and I was sorely unimpressed. It took a good fifteen minutes of footage before there was an edit or a line of dialogue that made any sense, and it took another 30 minutes before the hamfisted script gave way to a working plot that wasn't contingent on a closeup of Ryan Gosling's smile or contrived moralizing. After the first 45 minutes however, the script blossomed into a watchable albeit not completely entertaining or thoughtprovoking. The highlights certainly include both Gosling and Morse's acting, Gosling being an upandcoming star, and Morse being an extremely wellestablished character actor with a good feel for disparate emotions. As a sidenote, after the screening I was talking a little smack about the movie to some of my friends when David Morse walked right behind me -- He looks like the nicest guy in the world, but he's a solid 6'2 "" and probably outweighs me by 50 pounds. I removed my foot from my mouth and promptly changed the subject."
82,1,"Pitch Black is a survival story. It's about how to survive in an hostile, alien world against even more hostile enemies. The task gets even more difficult when the nearest enemies can be found within your own surviving group. The plot of Pitch Black is quite usual and has been seen several times before in different variations. But what makes this movie shine above others, is it's wellwritten characters. The group consists of very different people with few more interesting than the others: Jack, a boy with a secret; Fry, a pilot having hard time with her own conscience; Johns, a bounty- hunter with a drughabit; Imam, a holy man facing the fact that God is sometimes cruel and Riddick, a convict and a murderer learning to value others, not only himself. Characters start to live in the movie. They aren't only paper like in many other movies of this genre. You start to care for the characters, especially for Riddick though that feels quite odd. He is supposed to be the bad guy. In this movie, the line between light and pitch black is very thin. All characters are familiar with both. Other thing that works in this movie is the casting. Rarely do actors fit to their roles this well. Radha Mitchell is suitable for Fry. Cole Hauser brings the right amount of cruelness and sense of responsibility for Johns. But the most impressive work is done by Vin Diesel. He does great job as Riddick. In his hands Riddick is quite creepy, definitely very dangerous and also deep character, just as he is supposed to be. So, how do you survive in Pitch Black? Keep your friends close and enemies even closer."
83,1,"This, ladies and gentlemen, is truly a modern Bmovie. The dialog is stilted and delivered with wooden rigidity, the premise is predictable ( there are a few decent twists) and characters remain 2D for most of it. And yet there is a certain ... charm. WWE wrestler Kane brings to life the sick, twisted monster of a man with a lot of pathos ( though it is somewhat like his character that he's been playing around ten years) and so I'll find it quite amusing when people say it's "" not much of a reach for him, "" but Glen Jacobs is, apparently, quite the nice guy, so actually it is. In any event, he's cast perfectly as the hulking brute and the deaths are suitably over the top ( Jason would be proud), but I heard at least four applause breaks for four different kills scenes. Frankly go into this movie thinking that you'll have some fun and a gorefest, oh it is QUITE the gorefest. The Rrating IS richly deserved and I actually got a little nauseous during some of the more graphic times. In any event, a very, very fun, but fairly bad, movie."
85,1,"This must be one of the funniest Danish movies ever made. Ulrich Thomsen and Thomas Bo Larsen are hilarious, as they drive across Sweden. I don't know how Ulrich Thomsen does it, but somehow he can manage to play insane in a very sane way. BUT if you don't understand Danish ( I am not referring to your pastry here) don't waste your time on this    I don't think it would work with subtitles."
87,1,"The world is going to miss John Frankenheimer. This was his first feature film and it was four years before he directed his second, but don't let that dissuade you from seeking it out. Frankenheimer's direction is assured, and he gets some compelling performances out of his cast. Someone else has already pointed them out, but I also want to talk up James Gregory and Whit Bissell in two key supporting roles. Both would work for Frankenheimer again -- Gregory most notably as the bumbling senator in "" The Manchurian Candidate "" -- and they do good work for him here. If the whole thing seems too simple in the end, that's merely because Frankenheimer and writer Robert Dozier chose to tell a simple story, and they do it well. Keep a lookout for it -- Turner Classic Movies just might show it again."
91,1,"When I first saw this movie, I said to myself, "" Hey what the heck it sounds like a good movie, why not rent it? "". So yeah, I rented it and went back home to see it. When I inserted it in my DVD player I was shocked. Well FIRST of all, no one told me it was a Mexican movie and was spoken in Spanish, good thing it had subtitles. SECOND, it was nude, nude NUDE! Since I have no background whatsoever in Mexican movies, you could see my shock when I saw it.* GASP! Covering virgin eyes, NOO* THIRD, predictable to say the least, but actually being it predictable was no excuse to me in liking movies, because I don't seem to care if it's predictable, unless it's way over the top.    FOURTH, how Heidi and Kike were reunited, so cheesy.    FIFTH, how the movie ended. It was a BAD, BAD ending. How Mr. Van der Linde's sudden approval to the mayor's election was because her daughter, knew how to throw the party ... BLAH, Blah. I was hoping that he wasn't that easy to accept it, the director might have just rushed it.    After all of this bashing of the bad stuff, the good stuff's are here to come. The movie was actually quite hilarious at some point with Maribel being clumsy in the kitchen and all, Heidi's attitude, Valentina being poetic with words. What I really also like about it was the song that Valentina made with her girl friend. That's all, and for the other stuffs that I haven't mentioned they were just soso."
95,1,"There are so many episodes that make me howl over the stories that I wish I could pick the best ones, Rocko and Bill make for a strange pair that are beyond help but manage to play the victim and BS their way out of hard time just to drag Dan into their life of crime. Canadians will notice the odd joke for Toronto or the Federal Government, and because the CBC axed a really good show by the Frantics that Dan was part of, the show takes shots at them and in the episode "" Dan's Umbrella "" the CBC is raked across the coals. When Dan says that the CBC would never waste taxpayers money on useless venture, Rocko enters the room and gives Dan back his Tape of FridayNight with Ralph Benmurgue, this show was a flop and most people wouldn't get the joke unless they knew the CBC's history for making shows people don't watch or axing good shows that they do watch."
97,1,"Maureen O'Hara is always beautiful and appealing. Here she plays an actress terminally ill. We don't know with what. It is a bit of a precursor to "" Love Story "" in that respect. William Bendix is good, as is most of the supporting cast. John Payne is meant to be grieving but he seems to sleepwalking. The girl who plays the child he and O'Hara adopts does her best with a contrived plot device: Of course! Adopt an orphan. She will live on after the passing of your wife. It's a sweet movie but it doesn't feel sincere. I was hoping to be moved. I was, by O'Hara's gentle performance. But I don't like to feel manipulated."
99,1,"Book of Revelations starts very well. Daniel, an egomaniac dancer is kidnapped, abused and sexually raped by three masked women. After that, nothing else really happens. There is some hint of rediscovery but the movie gives nor explanation nor a real ending. Daniel reactions after the abuse are very basic. He quits dancing, has sex with every women around and finally starting a relation with very simple and common woman. I have seen a good share of arthouse movies but this has something missing in it. The main leads are fine; but some characters does not seems to be completely defined."
100,1,"Perhaps this movie is a little too long, but it still has some charm 45 years later. The main roles seem more appropriate for Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh. I could care less about Gary Cooper, but Ingrid Bergman is fine, particularly in dark hair. The movie is worth seeing for the supporting cast: Flora Robson is terrific as a mulatto servant. She is a white woman in blackface, and can have an expression of evil or of a voodoo mistress. Jerry Austin as a servant dwarf has a delightful role, that keeps you chuckling despite some overlong scenes. Speaking of scenes, Florence Bates steals most of the ones she is in as a dowager social lady. I didn't understand the outcome of the railroad fight at the end of the movie, and the last scene was pure Hollywood dreck. It's an odd feeling when you realize the film title refers to a railroad rather than a piece of luggage!"
101,1,"This movie had the potential to be a very good movie in my eyes, Nicholas Sparks is a great romance author and this movie had every chance to be just as great as The Notebook but what s sets the two apart is the notebook had a dream team of leads in McAdams and Gosling but here the balance is thrown miserably off by the inept acting of Channing Tatum I felt a lot of the scenes were uneven purely because of his performance, a lot of the emotion in various scenes is lost because he ca nt act, leaving an awkward and uneven situation, Amanda Seyfried given a great performance only to have Tatum drop the ball and the mood is lost and the scene ca nt recover. This story deserved to be cast right, but what it got was a pretty boy who ca nt act. Tatum should stick to what he s good at, movies that are more about his physical ability, albeit horrible, like GI JOE, step up, and Fighting. The less he talks the better. Try not to think of me as a jaded hater of Channing Tatum I went in to this movie with an open mind, because I've been surprised many a time by the likes of Adam Sandler in Reign over Me. I gave the same chance to Tatum I didn't view him here as the sum of his past roles, purely just by his performance in this movie, which sadly was a letdown"
104,1,"The Kissing Bandit was the third and final film that Frank Sinatra and Kathryn Grayson costarred at MGM with. The first two were Anchors Aweigh and It Happened in Brooklyn. And in both Sinatra wooed and lost Grayson. I guess the third time's the charm. For romance maybe, but definitely not for screen image. Sinatra in his forty's films once again plays the nice little schnook only this time in toreador pants. Poaching on Tyrone Power's territory laid out in The Mark of Zorro, Sinatra plays the son of a man who was a hotel owner by day and The Kissing Bandit by night. He's gone and left California for an education and has come back ready to take Dad's place, but in the hotel business only. And where does he learn the hotel business, Boston. Of course some of Dad's former gang members, grown a little old and paunchy led by J. Carrol Naish, want him to lead the gang again. But Frank's just not cut out for the outlaw life. But he does make a good impression on the Governor's daughter, Kathryn Grayson. Somebody must have had it in for Sinatra at MGM to cast him in this after the bad reviews he got in Miracle of the Bells. Frank's in a part that was more suitable for Red Skelton. But since this was a musical, I guess the brain trust at MGM figured Kathryn Grayson had to have a singing costar. In fact the best number in the film are for her, Love Is Where You Find It. Also Ricardo Montalban, Ann Miller, and Cyd Charisse do a dance specialty that is nice. Frank's songs are nice, but nothing spectacular. In later years, Sinatra would wince at the mention of The Kissing Bandit and with good reason."
106,1,"I originally watched this because I thought it was going to be the sequel to the League of EXTRAORDINARY Gentlemen and this movie is a whole different thing entirely going on herea comedy! However, I loved it anyways!    The League of Gentlemen is apparently some British TV series with some rather odd characters and some sharp humour. This is British comedy so it revolves around being very silly, dressing up in costumes and making lots of fun of Germans and french, homosexual references- in short it's very very funny! THe plot revolves around the writers of the TV show deciding to cancel some of the characters and the characters coming out of their dimension into the writer's dimension to stop that from happening. It's a fun twist and there's plenty of great scenes in this idiotic adventure. I laughed out loud numerous times and applauded the brazen style of humour. This makes Mr Bean look like the watered down wimp he is.(Rowan is much better in Black Adder series btw) This is not Monty Python, but you can never escape the comparison when you are talking British humour, and there are a few similarities but not so many as to keep it from being it's own thing and being fresh. It leans more towards the young ones and Guest House Paradiso in its ' comedic style. If you liked this, check out The Young Ones series and Guest House Paradiso movie, and of course, I assume the TV series League of Gentlemen must be rather funny as well."
110,1,"I thought Choke had potential, but I thought it could have been a much better film. It had some interesting twists and turns, but some of them seemed kind of pointless. When showing background on the two main characters, some of that really seemed to go awry. Most of it was sort of useless and didn't help the movie at all. This was also not Dennis Hopper's finest hour. However, the main saving grace of this movie for me was Michael Madsen. His performance was excellent. In this movie, he almost makes Mr. Blonde look like a nice guy. All in all, it was watchable. Still, I was left thinking some things could have been done differently. These things would have made the movie much better, in my opinion."
112,1,"This movie didn't do it for me, an avid SNL fan for the past 14 years. Jamie Gertz ' portrayal was OK, but there was something so offputting about the movie itself. The facts presented in the movie are totally skewed. But Merv Griffin produced it, so that would explain a lot. He was never on SNL, nor had anything to do with it. The points in her life when she was on SNL are backwards. When we first see her on SNL, walking through the studio with Lorne Michaels, the logo on the wall is circa 19881989, not 1975. And let's talk about the cast -- who are these people?? I have never heard of a one of them. Truly dissatisfying. This movie shows why TV movies are just that, TV movies."
113,1,"When I was young, I was a big fan of Chuck Norris. I just begun getting out all his old movies on video so I can see them through adult eyes. I remember that I really liked this one in particular, and thought it was one of his best. Now that I'm a little older, I can say that although it's thoroughly average, I still consider it one of his better films. In an acting stretch for him, Norris plays a cop haunted by his participation in the arrest and capture of a dangerous serial killer movie. Serial Killers are all the rage nowadays, and people would like to think of them as a wholly 90s invention. In contrast, it's good to see where the current infatuation has sprung from, most obviously, action movies ( as well as stalk n ' slashers) of 70s and 80s. While Norris attempts at both humour and any form of human compassion are hamfisted and laughable, nobody could kick someone in the head quite like Chuck. Being a big fan of Steve James also, I can recommend this film, ditto for genre legend Billy Drago, as well as seeing Mitch from The Blue Brothers in a supporting role. Not great, but it's better than anything Norris did in the 90s."
115,1,"I really think this movie deserves some Oscars! I really don't care what people can say badly about this movie ... because it's a really well played parts from Samuel L. Jackson, and mainly by Christina Ricci!! I'm a big fan of hers, right since I saw her in Addams Family ... been trying to watch all things she makes, and this is absolutely one of the best parts she played!! I love her looks ( even though people say she's not pretty ... I think she is ... and I love her eyes)!! The movie is about many things ... people say that is religious ... people say that it's about racism ... people say that is about drugs ... people say that is about nymphomania ... well ... maybe is a little bit of all that!! But what I truly feel is that this movie has a high level of eye opening for what blues is ... what it stands for ... and mainly were it comes from: life ... heart ... pain ... sorrow ... and above all ... spontaneous feelings!! I hope you get to see it ... if you are that kind of person that likes a movie not only from the pictures or the story it tells ... this is a good movie to see ... if your not ... well ... see it anyway ... ca nt hurt that much, and you get to see Christina Ricci acting so horny!! She's a fox!!"
117,1,"This movie has lots of action and little heart. Let's forget for a minute that it gets just about every aspect of the Russian Revolution wrongafter all we only have only under an hour here to tell our story. In fact, the czar abdicated after World War I proved a disaster for the country, and a provisional government tried to rule as a pseudodemocracy until the Leninists took power nine months later, mainly because they promised to immediately withdraw Russia from the war. Now, back to our story. Here we have the revolution being "" rumored "" in Russian newspapers in what appears to still be a functioning country until violence erupts suddenly and upends the life of nobleman Baron Nikita ' Nikki ' Krasnoff ( Douglas Fairbanks Jr.). He flees his home with his former servant girl Tanyusha ( Nancy Carroll) in tow, and they start to make a new life in Constantinople. Before the revolution the Baron made a regular habit out of making a play for the girl, not out of any real passion, but out of boredom as a diversion of sorts. The revolution doesn't change this, and he continues to try to take advantage of what is obviously a very simple girl. It certainly doesn't make the audience like this guy to see him toying with her so. Tanyusha follows the Baron because she literally has no place to go after the revolutionaries take over the Baron's home, and she has known no other life other than waiting on Nikki hand and foot. Once in Constantinople, Nikki quickly wearies of life as a penniless laborer, and that is when he meets up with his former lover, Russian aristocrat Vera Zimina, who has a plan for getting them to Paris where the Tsarists have congregated after the revolution. Unfortunately for Tanyusha, Vera's plan does not include her. This film manages to completely waste the considerable acting talents of early talkie actress Nancy Carroll. She does a good job with what little she is given to do, but that is not much. Lilyan Tashman is the standout here, even though she has only a small role as Russian vamp Vera. Lilyan was so often given supporting roles just as she is here, but her earthy voice and glamorous looks make her the center of attention in every scene in which she appears. Guy Kibbee even shows up in a humorous bit as an American tourist who is curious about the Russian royalty that has been forcefully ejected from their homeland."
118,1,"Imagine that "" Dragnet "" episode where Friday and Gannon go into a typical 1970 den of hippie inequity, but instead of giving everyone a lecture, they "" get some. "" That's "" Joe "" in a nutshell. This film of a workingclass bigot and a rich guy who's just killed his girlfriend's drugdealer boyfriend has dated terribly and most of the supporting acting is stilted, but it's still interesting to watch. Peter Boyle, then about 35, plays Joe ( the bigot), and he looks like James Gandolfini. In her film debut, Susan Sarandon plays the doeeyed daughter, and while she doesn't necessarily hint at her future greatness, you can't take your eyes off her."
121,1,"The film quickly gets to a major chase scene with ever increasing destruction. The first really bad thing is the guy hijacking Steven Seagal would have been beaten to pulp by Seagal's driving, but that probably would have ended the whole premise for the movie. It seems like they decided to make all kinds of changes in the movie plot, so just plan to enjoy the action, and do not expect a coherent plot. Turn any sense of logic you may have, it will reduce your chance of getting a headache. I does give me some hope that Steven Seagal is trying to move back towards the type of characters he portrayed in his more popular movies."
122,1,"I absolutely love standup comedy. I love to hear the raw thoughts of the standup on stage, as they are appealing to an audience of their peers different life experiences they have had, or things they have thought up or seen that they just thought were so**** ing stupid that they had to share it with someone.    There used to be standups who took on a persona that everyone could relate to ( Rodney Dangerfield comes to mind) or were just so damn crazy that you couldn't help but laugh with them as they laughed at others ( Richard Pryor). And then, there were the thoughtprovoking comics like George Carlin, who, despite pretending to be a loon, was the smartest guy in the room, who appealed to people to rethink things they saw when they walked around, and realize just how screwed up things were, and how easily they could change things. Now, this might seem to not have anything to do with "" Mind Of Mencia, "" which, as I agree with most commentators here, is Comedy Central's horrid solution to the loss of "" Chappelle's Show, "" but it does. Carlos Mencia spends half of the show doing standup bits for his audience, sometimes on popular topics, most of the time on just racism and racial stereotypes. He tries to be all three of the above types of standups. He makes a stage character, an everyday Mexican named Carlos who, despite stereotypes, is just your runofthemill normal guy. He then proceeds to try to laugh at others, people he calls racist or just those that disagree with his opinion. And then, finally, he presents skits to the studio audience and the viewer, telling them that it will help them see his point of view. Carlos Mencia always says he's showing a point of view that people don't see, yet what he is really doing is not only promoting racist stereotypes that already exist and have been joked about to death, but he stupidly encourages people to hear them and do the one thing that helps keep them around: laugh. Promoting stereotypes is usually the lowest, yet easiest, way to get laughs in standup. The best comedians, which, I fear, Carlos Mencia feels he is in good company with, don't have to resort to them. They talk universally, and ask you to laugh AT absurdity, rather than with it, like Mencia encourages. As he creates more skits or "" reallife "" situations that call for racism or the bashing of others with the use of it, he tells us, rather than asks us, to laugh, and actually presents these absurdities as truth, rather than just extremes of it.    His show is an insult to the minds of those who watch it. Mencia doesn't give us comedy and ask us to digest it and take from it what we want ( something that, as much as I hate to compare the two, was "" Chappelle's Show's "" finest quality) he tells us exactly how we should view it and react to it --- which, according to him, is to make a stupid face and say "" Dee Dee Dee! "" This show is appropriately named. It is indeed a show about "" The Mind of Mencia. "" It's Mencia's mind, through and through, and, as such, is nothing more than dumb entertainment. The show is tailormade to give life lessons to its core audience, 1424 year olds, about how stereotypes are bad, but that racial bashing is alright to Carlos Mencia, and therefore should be alright to you!"

In this alleged satire about greed, these mental midgets reveal their own hypocrisy: the McMansions, the McToys, the McChildren, the McIllegals who are paid peanuts to take care of the McMansions, the McToys, and the McChildren! But the main problem ( aside from the revolting bigotry) is the premise: as the former executive of a nowinfamous company, Dick would be the Big Scalp for every corporate headhunter in the country!

127,1,"If I compare two films with Sacha Cohen, Borat and Ali G then Ali G is immeasurably better. I'ts no master piece, but it's a film at least. Borat is complete garbage and I do not understand how it rated better then Ali G. I can not put my finger on it, there something wrong with the Ali G script: half of the jokes are as if written by a 15 years old, not by an adult scriptwriter. And a number of jokes including Mr Cohen's lower body are quite tasteless.    But the film actually comes together as a comedy and there are some valid jokes too that are funny: such as how Ali G becomes a member of government for doing something scandalous and stupid in the public ( sadly true in today's western society: people get careers for doing stupid things in public), also Ali's advice about immigrant policy and some others.    Ali G overall remains a sympathetic character, even though a kind of mentally underdeveloped for his age. But it's OK to watch, it's quite funny. But never ever watch Borat, it's awful and makes every intelligent movielover sick."
129,1,"The mystery and its solution was a great noir conceit. I do have some questions though, maybe I wasn't paying enough attention. Who killed the neighbor and why? Who killed the replacement girl and why? And some minor quibbles, they should have shown the stopoff at the hotel for the switch. Not that they should have shown the switch, but they should have shown Jim and the girl going in the hotel, Jim going to the bathroom, coming out and being told by the bartender that his girlfriend went to the car without him. then, Jim getting back in the car and seeing the sleeping woman, and little girl in his back seat. This would have given the viewer a sporting chance at figuring out the solution. I wish I taped it though, I'd like to see it again."
135,1,"The Violent Men is pretty good western that certainly benefits from its excellent cast. Edward G. Robinson is the big rancher trying to squeeze out the smaller ranchers one of whom is Glenn Ford. Ford is ready to sell to appease his fiance ( May Wynn) until Robinson's ambitious brother ( Brian Keith) murders one of Ford's hands. Then you know what happens next. Barbara Stanwyck is along as Robinson's scheming wife the kind of role in which she specialized. Dianne Foster plays their daughter who comes to admire Ford. The Violent Men is nothing more than a "" B "" plot with an "" A "" movie cast but it is very well done."
136,1,"Following the advice of a friend, I got myself this movie. I'm very fond of computers in generalhence why a 1995 film about identity theft on the Internet could not be left unseen. I had some bad echoes about it, but in the end, I wasn't so disappointed: the story, though classical, is kind of interesting and must have been really new back in the days when it was released in theatres. I was gladly surprised when I figured out that contrary to what we usually see, computerperformed actions are somehow realistic, as they use Windows 3.x and normal computers. The storytelling is median and not bothering the viewer. The end is typically American. The actors ' performance is globally OK, Sandra Bullock usually annoys me with her "" oh my god why me "" way to behave, but this time she seems to have controlled herself. I'd recommend that movie."
140,1,"If you want to see the true, vile nature of Communism, watch the movie DARK BLUE WORLD. ( Tvamomodr Svet) It recounts how the brave Czech pilots who refused to surrender fled to England to join the fight against the Nazis. After the war, the Communists feared they had picked up dangerous Western ideas about freedom. So, they had these heroic Czech pilots thrown into a nightmarish prison, where some of the guards were the same Nazis they risked their lives to defeat. If Hollywood wants to understand why so many of their movies fall flat, they should compare the character drama portions of "" Pearl Harbor "" with this movie. In Dark Blue World, you really make a connection to all the characters. In Pearl Harbor, everyone is like some slick cartoon version of a real person. There are innumerable instances of brilliant writing in this movie. One funny scene that sticks in my mind is when the character Karel is being taught English by a rather formal Englishwoman. When he can't pronounce a word, he ridicules the lesson. In typical stoic English fashion, the teacher calmly but forcefully confronts Karel, and shames him into behaving. The aerial battle sequences in this movie are amazing, and they help to keep the movie lively. I read that it cost$ 11,000 an hour to rent the planes, but it was worth every penny. Ladies, you are expected to cry at sad movies, but guys .... beware! This movie would make General Patton weep. And if you are a dog lover, you'll use up half a box of Kleenex. Don't say I didn't warn you."

143,1,"I really wish Hollywood would come up with some new ideas and quick. Instead they go around and recreate and mess up a perfectly good movie with a remake. This movie is awful from the DeMille version. All the way through this movie I was saying to myself, Huh???What????I don't remember that part. The only exciting thing in this movie so far was the parting of the Red Sea. And in Heston's versionit was a heck of a lot better than this version. Did anyone else see an atomic or nuclear bomb cloud fade in and out when the Red Sea was being parted? I think I did. Anyway, I MightMightwatch the last part tonight.

146,1,"What Game Over: Kasparov and the Machine does best is to delve into Garry Kasparov's psyche during the 1997 competition against IBM's Deep Blue. You see him becoming more and more paranoid, and increasingly unravelled, all because in the second game, Deep Blue made a move that seemed too human for his preconceived notion of chess computers. Kasparov thought then, and still does, that IBM cheated. Game Over tries to seem unbiased, but it is clear that the director thinks that IBM cheated. However, they give no real evidence to support the cheating claim, only intimations that IBM's security surrounding the computer room was because IBM really had grandmasters hidden in there overriding the computer on certain key occasions, and Kasparov's assertion that the computer didn't play like a computer usually does at one point in game two. In game two, Kasparov played a game that was designed to trick the computer, attempting to sacrifice a pawn in a situation where previous computer chess programs would have taken the pawn, leading to the computer's eventual loss. Deep Blue didn't take the bait, and Kasparov was so rattled because the computer seemed to play like a human that he didn't even see that he could have played Deep Blue to a draw and ended up resigning. That game psyched him out so much that he was unable to recover, and after playing games 3,4, and 5 to draws, lost game 6 horribly. The question of whether IBM cheated all comes down to that single move in game two, where the Deep Blue made the move that any human would make but that had, up to that point, tripped up computers. Joel Benjamin, a chess grandmaster on IBM's programming team explained in the documentary that they knew that chess computers always got tripped up in that situation, and consequently spent a lot of time and effort programming Deep Blue so that it wouldn't make the mistake that other computers do. If you believe Benjamin's assertion, then the case is clear, IBM did not cheat. Unfortunately, the director quickly moved on and never mentioned IBM's explanation for the rest of the movie, preferring to cut between shots of the chess playing hoax of the 19th century, The Turk, and shots of Deep Blue, hinting that Deep Blue was really controlled by a human as well. As someone who has an understanding of programming, the explanation by IBM makes perfect sense -- if you knew what you were doing, it would not be terribly difficult to put something in the code so that, if thus and so conditions are reached, then do thus and so -- in other words, tell the computer what to do if a situation like the one that Kasparov created in game 2 ever happened. This isn't cheating, it's doing a good job of programming a chess computer. In the end, it's eminently clear that the director thinks that IBM cheated, and the repeated comments about IBM's stock rising 15% the day that Deep Blue won suggest the idea that IBM cheated to pump its stock price ( Kasparov even compares IBM and Deep Blue to Enron). However, there is plenty of outside opinion, within both the chess and computer science communities, that Deep Blue won fair and square and that Kasparov lost because he simply couldn't get past his view of computers as "" dumb machines "" and got psyched out by a machine that didn't seem so dumb after all. I just wish that the director had let us see the alternative opinion."
147,1,"I've already seen spinoffs of cartoons such as The Flintstones, Scooby Doo, Tom and Jerry and Looney Tunes and most of them are great. When I saw the All Grown Up pilot in 2001, I thought it was interesting to see how the Rugrats would look in their preteens/ teens and it contained things that would usually happen during that time of life such as going to a concert, going to school and being grounded. The actual TV show is better because the Rugrats seem to wear different clothes in each episode and Angelica doesn't get punished as much as she did in the original Rugrats series. Tommy and Susie get punished in this series. I've also noticed references to Rugrats in this show and even flashbacks of how the Rugrats looked in the original series. They actually talk to the adults in this show because they're 10 years older. This show is aimed at a slightly older audience than the original Rugrats. Viewers of the original show may like this."
149,1,"Hey all, I just wanted to give you all a few crazy facts about this movie. I was actually one of the Makeup FX artists that help create the "" beast "" for this movie and I have to tell you the original creature looked absolutely amazing. I remember when we got the first photos back from the set we were all talking about how much of a shame it was that this creature was in a movie that would probably be pretty poor. What actually happened though was that Jason Palmer did the original makeup for the Sasquatch, but for some reason they had to go back and reshoot much of the creature. The sad part was that Jason passed away a few weeks before that and so the redone creature was no where near as awesome as the original one. For me it was quite sad because this was Jasons final movie, and he sort of got cheated out of his final fame due to the bad reshoots. Anyway, I thought you guys may find that a tad interesing, and if you would like you can head over to mmmyeah.com and check out some "" behind the scenes "" photos. Later, Jeff"
151,1,"Have you ever tried a kind of food that your friend made, and then said to yourself, "" wow, that was not a good mix ""? Well, that is how I felt after watching this film. Many viewers will be left highly uncomfortable with this weird mix of crime and very, very corny comedy. Its almost like watching Mr. Rogers play a ruthless gangster, very weird. Some things just don't mix and this film clearly proves that. There are some very good performances here, as Dean Stockwell, Mercedes Ruhle, and Alec Baldwin are all excellent, but that doesn't make up for the lack of balance and symmetry in the film. Jonathan Demme has done some excellent work in films such as Silence of the Lambs and Philadelphia, but seems to be out of his element with this one."

However, the detailed crucifixion scene is, in terms of historical accuracy, superior to similar scenes in such widescreen Hollywood extravaganzas as "" BenHur, "" "" King of Kings, "" and "" The Greatest Story Ever Told. "" Rather than dragging his entire cross to Golgotha, for example, John Rubinstein simply carries his crossbeam strapped across his shoulders to his outstretched arms. Nails aren't driven through his palms but instead through his wrists. His feet aren't nailed separately but one is placed over the other so that just one nail need be used. Incidentally, Rubinstein's flogging prior to his crucifixion ranks 35th in the book, "" Lash! The Hundred Great Scenes of Men Being Whipped in the Movies. "" Of course, Rubinstein and the two thieves wear modest loincloths, which probably isn't true to the shameful reality of Roman crucifixions, but allowances must be made.

165,1,"i consider this movie as one of the most interesting and funny movies of all time. It has so much highly intelligent thoughts in it, that anybody who thinks the movie is awful did not get it and is not able to recognize really deep philosophical themes, which are in it ( in all the 3 Schneider movies) without a doubt. Several universities in germany and throughout europe have made studies on Schneider's way of seeing things. By the way, Helge Schneider is a very intelligent and sensitive person and on of the Jazzmusicions in germany ( maybe europe). He is mostly inspired by the great M.Davis and T.Monk. So if you do not like him, it is ok, but please do not try to convince others that he might be stupid, cheap, boring or not funny. Because if you had to face this opinion in a discussion and if you are willing to really look into the art of H.Schneider you would have to "" surrender ""."
170,1,"What a surprise this film was. I've seen a good few of Fulci's horror and zombie flicks and was amazed that this was by the same director. He also wrote the screen play which shows that the chap was quite capable of crafting a detailed, complex story line. The dubbing on this is not good, but far from the appalling slop that only further hinders later howlers like ' Manhattan Baby '. The photography in this film is fantastic. A strange, almost futuristic highway appears throughout the film which focuses on a small town where young boys are being murdered. A scene involving the beating of a woman is uncomfortable to watch, yet refreshing in comparison to usual cinema violence.    What went wrong Lucio? Perhaps there is a strong case to suggest he had reached his peak with this film, and it slowly went downhill after that."
174,1,"This film is a cash in. A cash in reliant on a rousing theme tune created for an earlier classic. Yul Brynner has long since jumped ship and so have most of the production values. Lee Van Cleef takes over the lead role of Chris. I can't think of any actor who looks less like Brynner than Van Cleef. Hey, he could have at least shaved off his hair and lost the moustache, just for the sake of continuity. Some correctional centres show this movie in order to punish offenders. One step out of line and The Magnificent Seven Ride! is brought to the fore and wielded. They didn't even bother trying to make this movie not look like a TV movie! Abysmal."

187,1,"The make -orbreak of a love story for me is whether or not I like the characters and also if they click with each other. Matt is pretty unlikeable: aloof, braggart, seemingly lazy, and a misogynist. He's been hurt badly by his dysfunctional mom and this makes him a little easier to take. I guess I liked the details of his dysfunction -- he was believable. He overcompensates by bragging that he'l nail Amy. He acts so cool around Amy that he strikes out twice. When they do talk he can't show her who he really is. She empathizes and then stonewalls him at just the right moments. She seems so mature and strong that the traits of hers that come out later didn't seem to fit. ( For me.) I found her to be incredibly sexy and pretty, ... girl next door pretty, I call it. So I was going to like this movie unless it really screwed up. Funny things happen with the coach, but Matt's relationship with the other coach was inspiring. The football scenes at the end were perplexing. Matt doesn't carry the ball but seems to be a blocking back. Folks, he isn't the right size! He's fifty pounds too light for that position. But I thought his acting was skilled. I measure that by the way I wanted to wring his neck a couple of times during his scenes with Meredith Monroe. The film was all right. Meredith M was better than all right."
188,1,"This movie was a waste of 3 hours of my precious time .. in the first 10 minutes i was already annoyed as i am familiar with the real version on the story according to the torah ( 5 books of moses) ... but i decided to watch it to get my moneys worth and too see how bad it sucked. Well it sucked .. way more then i thought it would. First and for most lets start with the script and characters the skeleton that makes up the body of a movie. If you study torah at all you'll see that the story is all wrong here are some of the distasful mistakes: moses doesn't do slave work because he was in the tribe of levi, moses doesn't kill anybody at mount sinai .. but yet the movie depicts moses being whipped and aaron and himself killing people ... reeeealllly not!. When moses speaks to the burning bush he knows who he s speaking too but the movie makes moses look like an idiot, he states that he doesn't know who the gd in the bush is ... whatever|Aaron knews his brother well regardless of their distance growing up, aaron was known for his calm, composed peaceful nature but yet he is depicted as angry and arrogant in this movie. Moses looks like Jesus in this movie .. how ridiculous .... pharoah the real one was actually and ugly dwarf who sat upon a pyramid of stairs so he could appear bigger then he was and moses was more then 10 feet and in the movie pharoah is taller then him and he s hot with light eyes! The woman of Am Israel ( nation of Israel) covered themselves meaning their hair and bodies and they didn't dance or sing in front of men, they did not participate in the golden calf so they would definitely not dance with a man in public as the movie depicts. Moses's wife Tzipora was married to moses and she therefore covered herself and being as humble as they were did not cuddle or hold hands in public. Batia Pharoahs daughter ( the one who adopts him and saves him from the water) actual converted to Judaism and therefore would have been proud of Moses when he said he was going to go free his people.fast fwd to mount sinai moses comes down the 2nd time with two sets of tablets ... with gibberish writing on it .. at least put the writing in the holy tongue, hebrew or English and put it on one tablet not two sets .. Bottom line is the movie is horribly written, directed and the characters are all wrong .. basically EVERYTHING is wrong about the movie ... The old one is inaccurate as well but its more realistic, and they actors are believable. Am Israel Chai!"
195,1,"It's fun to watch a young James Cagney doing his thing. He plays the cheapskate Weights and Measures guy who takes his job very seriously, stepping on the toes of a group of crooked politicians. He is offered the world, but keeps his integrity. He is beaten and set up, but that's the problem. We never know if he is really in danger. They say he's in a spot, but still seems to have carte blanche to move around and do what he needs to do. At times he's so cocky he doesn't do much to protect himself. His allies are in the police department but just about everything else is pretty corrupt. He perseveres ( almost too good to be true), of course, and we pull for him. The problem for me is a lack of sustained suspense. It would have been much better if he had had to clear his name. He never drops into the depths, even when rejected by his wife to be. It's still fun with the bad guys kind of imploding. See it just to watch Cagney do his tough guy posturing."
197,1,"I hadn't seen this in many years. The acting was so good as I began this time, I thought, "" Great! Another movie I misjudged as a foolish young man. "" But then the theme started to be clear and I felt the same way. This was Hollywood, the seat of glamor; so the concept shouldn't be a surprise. But it is so condescending a concept I feel as if I need to take a shower after watching it. In brief, it tells us that even physically ugly people can seem beautiful to each other and even feel attractive. Dorothy McGuire is likable as the homely heroine. She seems to have been filmed wearing minimal makeup. Robert Young is injured in the war and feels scarred. His parents can't bear to look at him either. He seems to have all his faculties and in part, the notions of disability are outmoded. Herbert Marshall is on hand as a blind pianist. His character speaks is hushed tones and is omniscient. The best performance is given by Mildred Natwick as the owner of the title residence. She is bitter and dour but not made of ice. Her story is much more interesting, and believable, than that of McGuire and Young."
198,1,"This has got to be the worst show I have ever seen. I always liked Chuck Norris in Films, but why do we need to make these shows politically correct by adding a black side kick who is as threatening as Shirley Temple in Little Miss Marker. I also thought the show was limited because how many times can you kick a guy in the face and make it interesting. I know an African American who looks like this Trivette guy and he gets his butt kicked about once a week he is all attitude. Chuck Norris is the man and he deserves all the kudos he gets, I think this show started great but lost steam as time went on They should have dumped Chucks side kick"
200,1,"This one is one of those classic B movie following the exploits of 2 hobos. It's done really cheesily and Big Stupid running off oneliners like a cardboard cassanova. But Jack Elam steals every scene he's in as the creepazoid Jesse ( now Jerome!). My favorite scene is the lynch mob and the dad's voice going up 10 octaves ( "" You loved her? ""). Danny, Big Stupid's protege, is surprisingly stupider, but not as loathsome as our lead star. There's also a quaint scene of a guy pimping at the diner. Joyce Meadows is the sweet, naive nice gal and probably the least annoying. And those yellow ruffles ( RAWR!). Oh, and booze is evil according to Mr. Stupid. This movie's a hoot. Watch the MST cover of this and Crow's terrific Elam homage!"
201,1,"I'd been postponing purchasing this one ever since its DVD release    for one thing, because I'd been somewhat underwhelmed by this director's two other horror titles ( SQUIRM [ 1976 ] and BLUE SUNSHINE [ 1977 ]), but also the fact that the film itself is said to have been slightly trimmed for gore on the Media Blasters/ Shriek Show 2-Disc Set! I now chanced upon it as a rental and am glad I did    because, not only is it superior to the earlier efforts ( at least, on this preliminary assessment), but I also found the film to be one of the better imitations of THE Texas CHAIN SAW MASSACRE ( 1974). This factor, however, only helped remind me that I've yet to check out another such example    Wes Craven's classic THE HILLS HAVE EYES ( 1977), whose 2-Disc R1 edition from Anchor Bay I purchased some time ago but, after all, Halloweentime is fast approaching ...    Anyway, the film manages an effortlessly unsettling backwoods atmosphere ( it was shot in the forest and mountain regions of Oregon)    with plenty of effective frissons throughout but, thankfully, not too much violence ( even if the last of the villains is dispatched in quite an outrageous fashion!). The principal young cast here ( one of them played by Jack Lemmon's son, Chris) isn't quite as obnoxious as those we usually encounter in this type of genre offering    despite freely indulging in the shenanigans one associates with teenoriented flicks and which, by and large, persist to this day! George Kennedy appears as a sympathetic Ranger; though he doesn't have a lot to do, his characterization is decidedly enhanced by making him a lover of plant and animal life. Also notable among the locals is familiar character actor Mike Kellin in a nice role as the drunkard who first comes into contact with the murderous duo of the narrative    his warning to the teenagers, naturally, goes unheeded but he's later able to lead Kennedy to them. The hermetic family the teens come across in the woods, then, is eventually revealed to be hiding a skeleton in their closet. While one of the girls displays genuine curiosity at the intruders ' presence, the rest are openly hostile to them    and, in the case of the burly and uncouth twins, appropriately creepy ( one of them is even prone to maniacal laughter during his rampages); at a certain point in the narrative, the Ranger even offers an interesting explanation as to the nature of their aggressive and generally uncivilized behavior."
203,1,"This series continues to frustrate and annoy. How are they going to drag this out for another year? Each episode offers up more and more questions, whilst providing the answers to very few. To quote another very popular website, I believe that this show has now jumped the shark! Will, I keep watching it? Probably, Will they manage to keep the show onair till it ends? Probably not ... How did two qualified doctors fail to notice that Naomi was still alive? How did 30 plus people not notice a corpse wake up and walk off with a knife still in her back? How did someone have enough strength to create two trails and climb up a tree to ambush Kate? We've now introduced a ghostbuster ... Same time next week? yep!"
213,1,"WHENEVER an idea was successful during those "" Golden Days "" of the Silent Movies, you could bet your bottom dollar that it would be repeated; although "" Reworking "" is the term that is used. Of course one could make the argument that this reworking business has never left us, for success in the Movies or TV always leads to a trend; with all competing parties vying to come up with their own version of said hit Movie or TV Program. TO this last premise we strongly disagree; for this is copycatting or plagiarism, plain and simple. THIS, the last Silent Laurel & Hardy Short, surely must have been quite well received; for ANGORA LOVE ( Hal Roach/ MGM, 1929) was reworked on the Roach Lot, not once, but twice over the next three years. We were treated to LAUGHING GRAVY ( Roach/ MGM, 1931), in which the Goat was replaced with a cute, little puppydog. Also, the weather is transformed into the dead of Winter, in the middle of a blizzard. They also made other lineup changes with substituting Landlord Edgar Kennedy with Landlord Charlie Hall. THE second reworking of the hidden animal premise is the 3 Reeler, THE CHIMP ( Roach/ MGM, 1932), which substituted a female ape from a dissolved and defunct Circus, to which Stan and Babe were former employees. The Circus paid off its employees with their assets and the Boys received the Chimpanzee as their final payday. BACK to our original ' victim ', today's subject, ANGORA LOVE. Recomember? THE short starts off simply enough. The boys encounter the Goat on the street and the Nanny in return follows them back to their rooming house; after Stan feeds a doughnut to her. The comic moments that follow are generated with the interplay between L & H and slowburn exponent, Edgar Kennedy, their Landlord. The incident's impact is amplified by having the interplay occur at night. And as luck would have it; their room is situated directly above the Landlord's quarters. IN addition to the noise, the bathing of the goat, its odor and Landlord Edgar's suspicions about Laurel & Hardy's having another person illegally in the room; we were most amused by a little throwaway gag, which may well have been missed by the Censors. While admonishing the boys about the noise they'd been making and reminding them of the house rules about any unauthorized person's being in there overnight, regardless of their sex. ITS camera shot is made from inside The Boy's room, over their shoulder. With Edgar in the hall and facing them, he warns; "" Remember, this is a respectable establishment! "" Just as he says this, a lady clad in evening clothes walks across and behind the Landlord; followed by a uniformed Sailor, who cocks his hat forward as they pass! POODLE SCHNITZ!!"
217,1,"This film is enjoyable if you like poverty row, public domain films from the first half of the 20th century, or are a fan of amateur filmmaking. The film splices together public domain thrillers together along with newly shot scenes in which the "" actors "" ( With the sole exception of Redfield doing a near dead on Lugosi rip, all of the "" performers "" are simply dreadful!) attempt to interact with the stock footage. The "" New "" footage is covered with digitally added film scratches, as is some of the already substandard old footage (??!!). As near as I can figure out the plot has something to do with a bunch of strangers being brought together on an island for a will reading (?) This film, while boasting a creative premise ala ' Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid ', is a technical and creative wreck. In one dreadfully over long sequence and injured sailor on a ship describes an abortive trip to ' Fog Island ', whatever that is! The "" flashback "" then incoherently weaves together old footage from totally different eras, and of totally disparate film quality. Unrelated scenes from ' The Lost World ' ( 1925), The Most Dangerous Game ( 1932), White Zombie ( 1932), Bela Lugosi Meets A Brooklyn Gorilla ( 1952) and some other poverty row productions. This is done over an incredibly bad voice over which seems to have too much room echo as if the audio was recorded on a cheap home video camera. The "" filmmakers "" seem to think that they are paying homage to the great actors of yesteryear by giving characters the surnames of famous actors ( Carradine, Zucco, Ouspenskaya, etc .. etc ..). This tactic was done cleverly, as well as subtly in ' Final Destination ' here it's just obnoxious! Bizarre, and painfully unfunny, jokes about Spiderman, Dracula, and Superman abound. Even the old as dirt ' Dewey, Cheetam and Howe ' lawyer reference is used herethis was old and tired when The Three Stooges used it in the 1930s. The film stock and audio, don't match scene to scene, and dozens of different sources are used for Lugosi. The finale effect is that he seems to be getting, older, younger, older, thinner, heavier, younger and older again minute by minute. Oddly the film didn't use this as a comedy subplot and squanders a good chance for comedy. Truth be told though, It was great fun to watch this late at night in bed. Maybe that s what they wanted to happen!"
219,1,"I was fortunate to attend the London premier of this film. While I am not at all a fan of British drama, I did find myself deeply moved by the characters and the BAD CHOICES they made. I was in tears by the end of the film. Every scene was mesmerizing. The attention to detail and the excellent acting was quite impressive. I would have to agree with some of the other comments here which question why all these women were throwing themselves at such a despicable character.******* SPOLIER ALERT******** I was also hoping that Dylan would have been killed by William when he had the chance!**** END SPOILER***** Keira Knightley did a great job and radiate beauty and innocence from the screen, but it was Sienna Miller's performance that was truly Oscar worthy. I am sure this production will be nominated for other awards."
220,1,"I believe, that this is a heart tugging film. Richard Donner ( Directed the top grossing film "" Superman ""), had done a great job directing this film. Some of the segemets were good, and several were horrible because, Bobby ( Mazzello) was beatened by The King ( Baldwin, and especially their dog, Shane attacked the King which meant that he paid for what he had done to Bobby. Elijah Wood, portrayed a good role in this film. The memorable scene in this, he dreamt that he took the buffalo's advice about Bobby being battered. Lorraine Bracco, ( PreSoprano)had portrayed an impressing role. I give this film*** out of four!!!"

229,1,"17/02/09 "" More "" ( 1969) Dir: Barbet Schroeder    For a film that most viewers have agreed is pretty average, I'm impressed by quite how many differing interpretations have been offered of it. I've only scoured the web quite briefly and I've already been informed that "" More "" is: a 19th Centurystyle romance, an allusion to the story of Icarus, a plain film full of dull people, and of interest only to Pink Floyd completists. It's fair to say, then, that critical reception is mixed. I would argue that these wildly disparate readings of Barbet Schroeder's 1969 directorial debut are proof enough that "" More "" is anything but a pretty average film. Neither is it a masterpiece, of course. I approached "" More "" as I did "" Easy Rider "" and Antonioni's "" Blowup "" as a ' timecapsule ' film, a snapshot of an eradespite the differences in pace, style and content between these movies. They all have similar flawseither vague or downright unlikeable characters, acting that seems slightly adrift from reality, relaxed editing, and abrupt endings that have left viewers indignant. These movies never try to be persuasive or meet the audience half waythey are what they are, man. This in itself is not a problem as long as we are left with a souvenir of the experience. Thankfully, "" More "" offers several truly memorable images, sounds and suggestions to the viewer, and this is what saves it. Stefan is a young man who arrives in Paris fresh from his studies in Germany. The first part of the film follows him as he falls in with a group of French hipsters, accompanies them to devastatingly cool and selfconscious parties and bars before meeting Estelle. The two characters become sexually and romantically involved and he promises to follow her to Ibiza, against the advice of his friend Charlie. This is where the Icarus thing comes into playshe is the Sun, he is pursuing her. You may now be able to guess how this all ends. Ibiza is an idyll so far away from the bustling urgency of the overpopulated Paris that the naive Stefan knows he must be on to a good thing. Estelle remains elusive and erratic, and the island has a less desirable underbelly. Up until now I had cared little for either of these characters and their unfocused pursuit of somewhere to be really free, but once the action is pared down to just these two the film becomes poignant quite suddenly. During just one single wistful exchange of dialogue in the remote villa they inhabit, the place where their volatile love crystallises, I went from watching with a fading optimism to being utterly enraptured. I can't think of many other films that have done this. The relationship between Stefan and Estelle is real and human in that we can see it go from lifedefining intimacy to disillusionment and cruel coldness. They take a lot of drugs and cavort naked on the terraces, the rocks and beaches. Their lives revolve around nothing but each other and the beautiful Mediterranean surroundings. For a while, their situation is the very essence of freedom, emotional openness and experience for its own sake. But Stefan is not in control, and this is the downfall of more than just his future on Ibiza. Pink Floyd's score is a perfect fit for the exoticism, the intimacy, and the foreboding of "" More "". It is one of the most memorable inclusions, along with the mosquito netting around Estelle's bed, and their hallucinogenic exuberance around the windmill ( which appears on the soundtrack album's front cover). A scene in which they take acid to escape from heroin withdrawal is illustrative of the fundamental flaws of the couplethey can not ' land ' without a crash. Maybe they've come too close to what they wanted. Stefan never makes contact with any family or friends from before his arrival in Paris. We are left to presume they have no idea where he is. While other 1960s Counterculture movies dwell on debauchery, excess, the media and voyeurism, Schroeder has instead presented us with a story focused upon one man, who backs himself into a little corner somewhere in the world and quietly disappears."
230,1,"Hilarious!! I would have sworn Ed Wood wrote this. Terrible. I loved every frame. Bad movie aficionado's, this is your trophy! I will watch it again. Words can not explain how entertaining this movie is. Pare's career must have dipped low, but I really think he's heading in the Leslie Nielson direction. He was perfect for this. Terrible, just terrible!! You'll love it!! Get some friends, lots of beer, and you'll have the time of your life. It's an MST3000 party, waiting to happen. Enjoy!! It is worth the rental!! You like the "" Colombo type "" cop and the comic relief coroner. The bad guy will have you on the floor laughing. He's also in another Pare movie, Komodo vs Cobra, and he's just as good there. I don't know what the budget was but they'll get it back because this film is destined to be the best unintended comedy of the year."
233,1,"This movie was Jerry Bruckheimer's idea to sell some records. No seriously it was. The thinking behind it is that if you made a film full of pop songs you could stick the tracks on a LP, sell it and make even more money for the studio. You could also release a few tracks as singles and intercut the promo video with clips from the movie so that when MTV play a track you're actually getting free advertising for the movie. This is a good business deal but an artistic disaster because many of us still have nightmares about Hollywood movies from the 1980s and I rate the mid 1980s as the poorest time in artistic terms for American film making and FLASHDANCE opened the door to this "" Let's make a 90 minute pop video instead of a movie "" type film making Jennifer Beals plays Alex Owens a dancer who works as a welder to make ends meet and right away logic disappears with this career choice. Welding is a fairly sophisticated trade, it's not something you walk into and learn in five minutes. There's other gaps in logic like ballet dancing and "" flashdancing "" being somehow similar. ie if you apply to be a ballet dancer and do some hot, dirty flashdancing the male judges might want to meet you after the audition but you won't get the job. it's kind of like saying that screen writing, novel writing and play writing are somehow the same when they're not    But I guess none of this mattered to Jerry when he asked director Adrian Lyne to make the movie. Actually Lyne almost makes a very sexy movie, JenniferBeals is very sweet and innocent looking. Fortunately I sussed out why her face is brightly lit in close up while her silhouette is darkly litin long shots except when the camera cuts to close ups of her heavenly toned body. That's because a body double is used most of the time and frequently the body double is a man! I bet there's a few naughty boys who are feeling guilty not to mention slightly disgusted to know that"
237,1,"A German freshman, Stefan hitch hikes to Paris during summer break were he falls for a mysterious young woman he meets in the Paris freak scene. He then follows her in the famous isle of Ibiza, the hippie joint were meets Wolf, a man who throws HitlerJugend knives, owns bars and hotels and keeps Estelle under his thumb with dope. The couple tries to escape Wolf, Stefan gets hooked with dope and jealousy for Estelle, who's groovy and a free spirit. Great photography and music, plot is quite usual for the period but it's not an exploitation kind of movie, cold and dramatic. The moral is quite strong ( he was looking for the sun ...) but I would not say it's a film against drugs even it puts enphasy on drug use."
242,1,"The 80s were overrun by all those HALLOWEEN/ Friday THE 13TH slasherstyle horror movies, so this is something of a relief.

During a "" past life sance "" a demon is accidentally released, and each person becomes possessed and kills off the others. This all sounds very EVIL DEAD/ DEMONSish, but Tenney lends some directorial style to the proceedings, there are some good oneliners, the music is excellent, the Steve Johnson prosthetic makeup FX are scary and Linnea Quigley is quite fun as a boycrazy bimbo who pokes out eyeballs with her fingers and does an amazing new thing with a tube of lipstick! Great fun on a nobrainer level! After checking out the breakdown of the voting and the other posted reviews, I don't understand how this only received 4 out of 10 (?!) I give it, 8 out of 10."
254,1,"My friends and I have watched this so many time I have lost count. This is worth seeing for those in the right frame of mind, meaning that this is not so much a good horror film as a film to lampoon for its funny quotes and bad effects. This film is best watched with other like minded individuals so you have someone to laugh with. You'll laugh as Greg leaps and shuffles around the lab, petting his pet rabbit, while his hunchback shifts from right to left on his back. "" Greg, stop clowning! "", scolds Dr. Brandon. You'll laugh as J.G. Patterson gives hand signals to direct Greg to the other side of the operating table, while his hand is in the shot. And you'll probably chuckle when you realize that the final woman has none of the features he used to construct her with."
256,1,"There were many ' spooky ' westerns made in the 30s and early 40s, and although this has a strong beginning, it isn't one. Randy Bowers ( John Wayne) stopping at a ' Halfway House ' saloon, finds it to be full of dead bodies, the bartender's corpse draped over the bar holding a gun, eyes watching Randy from behind holes cut through eyes in a picture, and a player piano playing "" The Loveliest Night of the Year. ""    It was the result of a robbery by the Marvin Black gang, to get Ed Rogers '$ 30,000. Randy is an investigator who "" works alone, "" who wastes little time in getting arrested, escaping ( with Ed's daughter Sally's help) and literally landing in the midst of the Black gang's hideout behind a waterfall. It all moves along fairly quickly. Only one too many chases after Randy slow it down. We even get George Hayes, clean shaven and playing two parts-- Marvin Black, the vilest villain, as well as the Good Citizen, Matt the Mute, who communicates via handwritten messages. Having him play two opposite roles was a good idea, but the writing down of messages thing gets old real fast, even for him, as he finally gives up doing it near the end saying to Sally, "" Ah, I'm fed up with this! "" You can find George playing a vile, vile, double crossing villain in the serial "" The Lost City "" ( 1934). I think this is the only ' Lone Star ' film in which the title relates to, or is mentioned in the film! Sally offers her hand to Randy and says, "" He's not alone anymore! "" Then cut to their arms around each other as they look out facing a lake. Sally's running off with Randy seems too abrupt and not sufficiently prepared for. Too much time spent on horseback escaping the sheriff. Not that bad considering everything, but not that great either. I'd really give it a 4 and a half."
271,1,"I will not say much about this film, because there is not much to say, because there is not much there to talk about. The only good thing about this movie is that our favorite characters from "" Atlantis: The Lost Empire "" are back. Several of the bad things about this movie are that it has horrible characters, it has horrible comedy, horrible animation, and James Arnold Taylor trying to copy the wonderful, one and only Michael J. Fox as Milo James Thatch. The reasons for my criticisms are that all the characters are changed into something that they never were, and never should be, animation that has been downgraded to the lowest extent possible, and finally, why would somebody who did wonderful voiceover work for ObiWan Kenobi in "" Clone Wars "" want to copy Michael J. Fox? I happen to have an answer to this. Because they are the same person who thought he had to copy Eddie Murphy from Mulan in Mulan II. Yes, sadly, it is true .."
272,1,One of Bolls better attempts. Just shows that if you do something long enough you have to improve just by chance. It is still not good but it is at least watchable which is an improvement over the bloodrayne. The main difference between Bloodrayne and FarCry really is that the story from Farcry wasn't the games strong point whereas Bloodrayne had a strong story and thus Boll had more chance to mess it up. The action in this movie is actually fairly good. Occasionally a touch overdone but in a good way and worth a watch just for that. Acting wise it was pretty decent. Most of the actors are pretty good but you can tell they aren't taking it seriously based on comparisons with other performances. But the lighter mood this gives to the film actually helps. While I think sticking a little bit closer to the story of the game might have made for a slightly better film the changes made are pretty practical and not big enough to make a difference. Especially given the plot of the game was hardly Oscar winning just a vehicle for FPS carnage. Would have liked it set in the Jungle as that was a pretty integral part of the game but Canada doesn't have a great deal of Jungle and it is at least set in a kind of rainforest. Why Boll feels the need to change already professionally scripted and directed game plots I don't know but he does. And until he starts letting the source material speak through his adaptations will always be lacking. Watch the film for a laugh its good for that and maybe for watching during a party as drinking party fodder.
273,1,"I grew up with the Abbott and Costello movies, A. because my dad grew up with them and both our last names are abbott so we owe the deo a bit of respect, I did nt realize the flack this movie and others of there s gets. It was a really clasic due, it was funny cause abbott and costello were always the same characters, but it was sooo funny, now what i like about jack and the beanstalk is that even though the love story is totally boring and that one song the prince sings, omg, awefull, but i like the angle they took on the love, story, the couple has to get married cause one kingdom is running out of money, they meet in the jail cell and fall in love becaue they both pretend not to be royal and they end up being the couple, so happy ending, i do nt think that was the orginal version, if it was they should have cut it out of this movie, but i think it was orginal and i love it. but watching it sucks, lol, also when the movie really kicks in with the giant + abbott and costello it is sooooo funny. when the giant is beating jack into the door and jack is screaming "" OPEN THE DOOR, OPEN THE DOOR "" that stuff is really funny. And that once joke where jack starts screaming prince, prince and all those dogs jump him. kinda cheezy but really orginal. i wish they would have al least tried to remaster it, though i got that africa screamsjack and the beanstalk, and i do nt mind the quality cause when i had it on tape it was bad quality also so whatever i guess. the begining is mildly funny the middle is really really funny, and the end is not funny in the least, but i am 19 years old and when a movie made in 52 makes me laugh this hard, it rocks, this movie is really funny. i love their style. also the chapters suck. also the part where jack is climbing the beanstalk and they are all singing a song about what a dipstick jack is and that he will be killed, that s pretty funny"
277,1,"Well, I have to say, this movie was probably the funniest movie I have seen all year. And I don't exactly mean that in a good way. This is probably the most pathetic movie I have seen in a while, and yet that's what makes it so hilarious. you can tell these people are really trying to act, unfortunately for them they aren't doing such a good job, making it so even lines delivered in what is supposed to be a serious tone come out sounding really funny. Aaron Carter is essentially playing a character quite similar to himself in real life, and still he manages to make the character seem corny and not at all realistic. This movie is one of those movies where everything that is supposed to sound serious comes out really funny and all the things that are supposed to be funny are just so stupid and corny that you have to laugh because you know how hard they are trying. This movie is so bad, it's actually good. I would definitely recommend it if your in the mood for a good laugh."
281,1,"In 1932, Humphrey Bogart was a relative unknown -- an unproven actor who was starring in one of his first films. And, because he was an unknown, the movie they gave him was clearly a Bmovie -- a quick film with relatively low expectations. After seeing it, I could see why it would still take Bogart many more years AND another film studio before he became a household name. While the film isn't terrible, it certainly isn't good -- making it more of a curiosity than anything else when seen today. Bogart is a pilot who has dreams of building his own aircraft engine company. However, when a vacuous rich playgirl comes his way, his dreams all seem to go on hold. As one of the characters in the film said, the combination of the two is like oil and water -- they just don't mix. While Bogart is throwing away his promising career, his sister is going full speed on the Road to Skankville -- having met a sleazy guy who convinces her to sleep with rich guys so they can shake them down for tons of cash! Bogey has no idea his sister ISN'T the actress she claims to be and doesn't realize later that the rich woman he loves leaves him for the same guy whose mistress is .... Bogart's SISTER!!! All this leads up to a finale that is reasonably enjoyable. However, what follows is one of the dumbest scenes I have watched in a very long time! By now, the rich lady is not going to marry the guy sleeping with Bogey's sister ( whew!) but because she's now poor and no good for Bogart, she's about to fly away and kill herself. Bogey finds out, chases the plane on foot, jumps on the plane as it's taking off and crawls up the fuselage to take control of the plane and save her!!! This is so utterly silly and ridiculous, I found myself laughing out loud. Up until then, I might have scored it a 4 or 5-this sunk the movie to a 3 ( how one reviewer gave this an 8 is beyond me). The bottom line is that this was a talking and silly film. On top of that, it's all wrong for Bogart, as the action hero at the end and the simpering lover are horrible matches for his persona that was so wonderfully created in the early 40s. Manly and solid better suits the man -- one of America's great actors but clearly out of his element here. By the way, those who love PreCode films and their very adult sensibilities may want to see this one. Practically everyone in the film believes in and practices premarital sex and Bogey curses in the film -- things you never would have seen after the toughened and more moralistic Production Code was adopted in 1934."
283,1,"Don't watch this movie expecting the Jane Austen wit, crisp dialog or clever social commentary. This time around, the premise of Northanger Abbey has been updated in a very sensual way!    In this version, Catherine's erotic daydreams are not just silly fantasies, but a connection to the world of adult sexuality she is just peeking into with her daylight adventures. By day she is very prim and demure, and her swain Henry treats her with the utmost courtesy. But as her own sexual nature awakens, her daydreams shift every so subtly from mild to steamy to lurid!    At the beginning of the story, Catherine's visions of sex are based entirely on the Gothic novels she devours in bed. It is both heartwarming, sexy, and provocative to observe the way her dreamy picture of handsome Henry "" dissolves "" into a lurid dream of being carried off and ravished by romantic villains! At the same time, it is wry and touching to cut back to her bed in the morning -- Catherine sleeping peacefully looks so innocent one would never guess what really goes on in that pretty little head!    Later, after being invited to Henry's castle, Catherine overhears a family argument and totally misunderstands its meaning. Jumping into bed, she covers herself up with the bedsheets and lies awake listening fearfully, her striking blue eyes the only visible sign that she is alert. Little by little, however, those pretty blue eyes droop and close as she drifts into another heated dream of innocent desire. This time, Catherine dreams she is in Elizabethan times, waiting fearfully outside the castle for the approach of the "" banditi! "" It's pretty clear she is more excited than terrified by the idea of being carried off by bandits. She all but shudders with excitement and anticipation! But then, after a shot of her running frantically to escape, we are back to the daylight world, where the maid is scolding her for having made a mess of her room before falling into a sound sleep. It's worth noting that Catherine's heavyeyed yawning in the morning light is itself a rather sensual symbol of how passionate her dreams have been!    Ultimately, of course, Catherine's stern and unimaginative lover Henry divines the nature of her fantasies and gives her a stern lecture. It's interesting that Catherine's immediate collapse into tears symbolizes not a retreat but an advance into adult relationships. In the next scene, she tearfully burns her Gothic romance and throws herself shamefaced and sobbing onto the bed. Significantly, this turning point is also marked by Catherine falling into a deep sleep -- except that this time, there are no dreams of make believe passion. Presumably, Catherine has matured enough to be ready for the real thing. Though Katherine Schlesinger has lovely blue eyes and a lively expression, and all her performance is charming, it must be said that outside of the heated dream sequences this movie adaptation is excruciatingly dull. I'm giving it 9 stars only because the truly romantic may enjoy it purely on a daydream level. If you'd like to read a book about a genuinely strong willed young heroine who overcomes real darkness and danger in a real Gothic setting, I highly recommend THE PERILOUS GARD by Elizabeth Marie Pope."
287,1,"Since this show was changed from TSS ( the screen savers) to AOTS ( attack of the show)it has gone down hill. TSS with Yoshi and Kevin Rose Alex ... etc. Made the show awesome, then they got fired from TSS for an unknown reason. When the show switched to AOTS, it became less about computers, and more about gaming and magazines. It also promoted bands that nobody had heard of, or cared about. Finally I couldn't watch it anymore once Kevin Rose left. He kept it interesting, but he went off to do his own thing, which is good. Kevin Rose now has several online pod casts, and shows, etc on the REV 3 network. Check it out. REV3.com I think, you can get to it by going to www.systm.org. If you want a real tech show rather than aots, then go watch Kevin Roses shows or listen to the tWit podcast. J <"
291,1,"This isn't the video nasty Night of the Demon as there are more than one. Actually, there is only one, but it multiplies. After it inhabits Suzanne ( Scream Queen Linnea Quigley), she passes it on to goth girl Angela ( Amelia Kinkade) through a nice long kiss. Next, we see Linnea showing us her quigleys in the bathroom. She shows a lot more as Jay ( Lance Fenton) thinks he is in for some fun. Soon, everything literally goes to hell as bodies drop one by one and are possessed. Judy ( Cathy Podewell) and Max ( Philip Tanzini) are the last two trying to escape. Max isn't much help, leaving it to Judy to figure a way out. The makeup was absolutely fantastic, and the only thing that kept this from being even better was the extremely long build up to the action. The old man ( Harold Ayer) who appears in the beginning will be back and get his just desserts. Linnea Quigley may be the Scream Queen, but Cathy Podewell definitely showed the greatest lungs in this film."
298,1,"Carrot Top's "" Chairman of the Board "" and his AT&T commercials are living proof that flyblown fecal matter is available in the color orange. Not FREELY available, however, as HBO charges for such garbage. Blehhh! The saving grace of COTB is that it surely fills suicide hotlines across the country, perhaps providing employment for thousands of telephone therapists who lost their jobs when recovered memory treatment was discredited, although ( sadly) Carrot Top probably contributes to his sponsor AT&T's bottom line with the increased phone traffic from devastated HBO viewers. I can visualize the hordes of traumatized TV viewers, phone in one hand and fully loaded .45 auto in the other hand, dialing out of lastminute desperation before walking off the plank of life to escape the specter of COTB's orangehaired monster echoing in their synapses like the agony of searing, irreversible meningeal swelling."
301,1,"There's a unique place in the pantheon of John Ford films for Wagonmaster, Sergeant Rutledge, and The Sun Shines Bright. It was these three films with no box office names in them that Ford didn't have to tailor the film around the persona of a star being it John Wayne, Henry Fonda, or any of the others he worked with. Not surprising that Ford considered all these as favorites of one kind or another.    Ben Johnson and Harry Carey, Jr. a couple of likable cowpokes sign on to guide a Mormon wagon train to a valley in Arizona territory. Along the way they are joined first by a group stranded players from a medicine show and then by a family of outlaws on the run named Clegg. Their stories merge and what happens is the basis of the film's plot. Had Wagonmaster been done even 10 years earlier on the strength of the two performances turned in by Johnson and Carey, both probably would have had substantial careers as B picture cowboys. In the case of Johnson it would have been art imitating life. Johnson was a real rodeo cowboy and came to Hollywood with a string of horses for John Ford to use in Fort Apache. Ford was struck by his presence and the rest is history.    But the day of the B western was drawing to a close and Johnson and Carey had great careers as two fine character actors. Ward Bond plays Elder Wiggs leader of the Mormons. Bond is a recent convert though and has trouble remembering to not use some four letter words. But he's the leader because of his strength of character, not his impeccable LDS theology. He turns out to be a wise and compassionate leader. In portraying the Cleggs, Ford only had to reach back four years to his My Darling Clementine. They are the reincarnation of the Clanton gang and pure evil. In fact if Walter Brennan who after My Darling Clementine refused to ever work for Ford again was willing I could easily see him being cast as Shiloh Clegg the head of the family. As it was Charles Kemper did a fine job, this is probably the role he's most noted for. Shortly after this film was done, Kemper was killed in automobile crash. He might very well have worked for Ford in the future. Ford makes the Mormons pacifists here and I don't recall that pacifism was part of LDS doctrine. Nevertheless it works here, the whole idea being that these people who carry no weapons are innocents when dealing with evil people like the Cleggs. It takes some gun toting cowboys to properly dispose of them. I think that this post World War II film is trying to say that pacifism isn't always the best policy.    Another carryover from My Darling Clementine is Alan Mowbray playing the same kind of role he did there as head of the medicine show troupe. Part of that troupe is Joanne Dru who's doing another turn as a woman of elastic virtue the same as she did in Red River. Dru used to do so many westerns that she longed to be out of gingham and into some modern fashions. Wagonmaster is great entertainment and I'm willing to wager in the state of Utah it's a pretty popular film."
303,1,"Not a terrible movie ... But there are monster scenes where you will be rolling on the floor laughingnot a good thing for a action/ thriller. The acting is generally pretty decent for a SciFi channel movie. Barry Corbin plays a credible US senator, and Lou Diamond Phillips again gives us a decent military/ police/ sheriff/ agent/ marshal figure. The special effects are well, "" special "" for example, the external train shots are very obviously a model train. Goofs: A meteor strikes a stationary car in the opening scene. The car bursts into flames but does not budge an inch. After the impact, the meteor is lodged in the top of the car's hoodimpossible from the low angle that the meteor came in at. Spoilers ... A good portion of the movie's events are predictable, from the helicopter crash ( "" Pull up, pull up! ""), to the fact that the annoying people get it in the end, to the classic blown bridge over a 1000 foot gorge awaiting the train, to the sequel setup at the end. The scenes showing the aliens attacking are hilarious. They are vicious cute puppets and move at lightening speedremember the Monty Python rabbit? Spoiler Goof: In one scene four people shooting clip after clip can not hit a single creature because they move at lightning speed. Later in the movie Todd Bridges rigs up a mini flame thrower which he uses to dispatch a number of creatures at close range. On several occasions, Lou Diamond Phillips is able to easily grab creatures with his bare hands."
304,1,"Ocean's Twelve: just plain stupid, bad and nothing compared to the other two. An art robbery. 10 known actors, at least. A weak script and very slow developing idea. That's why I characterize a movie I only saw at least 20 minutes of it. Don't get me wrong, you may like it. But I only like the Ocean's films because of the Heist theme. If Ocean's 12 it's not about Heist then what's the point to see it? Glad Soderberg saw his main error and redeemed himself by making a film far superior to the first one. Kudos for that. Steven Soderberg isn't really a good director. Apart from his hit "" Sex lies and videotapes "" ... nothing else happened so much great to the career of this director. Shame on him. But his fault only."
313,1,"The original Airport ( 1970) was a classic of its kind, and the first two Bmovie followups ( Airport 1975; Airport ' 77) were watchable fun at best, amusing camp at worst; but this crass and inept final entry lacks any entertainment value and displays a shocking contempt for its audience. It's unendurable and not even good for laughs.    All of the three "" Airport "" sequels were theatrical releases made by Universal's television wing but this one is beneath even the modest standards of a TV movie of its day, with cheapjack production, grotesque casting, visual ugliness and tasteless, unfunny "" comedy "". The project was clearly doomed by the "" creative "" efforts of Universal executive Jennings Lang who personally produced and is given a "" story "" credit. Everyone starts somewhere, and writer Eric Roth ( Forrest Gump) might have provided an element of selfburlesque, as had the previous films ( especially the notorious Airport 1975), but there is nothing worth spoofing in Roth's turgid, incoherent script and even the comedy Airplane! left this crud untouched. What makes The Concorde: Airport ' 79 particularly offensive is its insulting misuse of professionals. The worst victim is the supremely gifted Cicily Tyson ( Sounder; The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman), pitilessly reduced to a vomitous subplot involving her escorting a frozen heart transplant on the unfortunate flight.    A special kick to the groin is reserved for the wonderful George Kennedy, who is the true lead despite being buried in the cast list. The official mascot of the "" Airport "" series and the only actor to appear in all four movies, Kennedy had more than earned the starring role and his turn in the Captain's seat would have been the only possible reason for this entry other than the squeezing of one last buck. Kennedy provides the only warmth and real humor in this mechanical muckup, briefly putting aside the bravura machismo and revealing a genuinely sweet and tender side to himself, and his lovable and heroic character of "" Joe Patroni "". Unfortunately we are never allowed to forget how fat and old and overthehill Kennedy is, and overage prettyboy Alain Delon relentlessly calls him "" Porky Pig "" as part of a buddybonding that falls completely flat. Even Kennedy's Parisian romance, the only humane part of this planewreck, turns out to be merely a setup for a hateful joke at Patroni's, Kennedy's, and the viewer's expense."
339,1,"As a local performer, I thought that "" Grease "" showcased what Broadway producers are looking for and it highlighted a small bit of the acting population. Although my favorites did not win ( but came in second), I enjoyed comparing myself to them and seeing what I liked and where I could improve as a performer. They brought in Olivia NewtonJohn because she is the obvious link between the Broadway production and television audiences. They sang songs from the movie ( "" Hopelessly Devoted, "" et al) because these songs will be included in the new production. I agree with the earlier comment made that the B'Way cast looks so much older, but you must bear in mind that these are people who have been on Broadway and worked their tails off to be there. If the entire cast was green and fresh then I believe that would have compromised the casting process by which producers choose their talent."
343,1,"A nice and pleasant movie full of meditteranean sceneries ( Cephallonia is a very beautiful greek island) that keeps many of the novel's characteristics. I think that greek sceneries add something special and magical to a movie. One thing i didn't like at all though, is that the main characters, like ' Mandras ' and Pelagia's father weren't greek actors but foreigners. I mean the actors tried to express the greek way of living, but to me they didn't succeed and it was quite clear. Even their pronunciation when they were trying to use greek words was terrible and that was bad for the film's plot. Irene Papas was really great in her role, a typical example of a mother, living in a island during the 40's, who has lost her husband and tries to live a child alone. John Hurt, Pelagia's father, also acted great. He reminded me a greek in many of his reactions."
345,1,"I am sure I'm in the minority ( I know I am among my friends), but I found this movie long, boring and gratuitous. The fact that the role played by DENIS LEARY is the most likable character ( the only other time I liked him at all was in "" A Bug's Life ""!) speaks volumes. Rene Russo's character was irritating beyond belief and Thomas Crowne himself was flat and stereotypical. To say he was twodimensional may be a little generous. ( No, the scenes with his psychiatrist did NOT help make him real.) With the exception of two wonderful scenes ( both involving the museum caper and NOT involving Rene Russo), this movie made me wish I were at home watching televised golf."
352,1,"I was expecting a lot from Mr. Amitabh Bachan's role of SARKAR, but am disappointed. Being a Ram Gopal Verma's direction i was not ready for this kind of a movie. Sarkar is supposed to be a strong character, but the movie shows that Amitabh is too dependent on others power rather than his. There is a movie in Tamil called Nayakan based on the theme of GOD FATHER and Kamala Hassan has played the lead. The movie is well directed and the power till the end remains in the hands of Kamala Hassan, not his son. Amitabh Bachan seems to be too helpless in the movie and he just accepts everything instead of changing things. The movie fails to show the strong impact of God Father."
356,1,"This goodguyvstheeviltyrant story, set in 19th century Russia, may have been an attempt to extend Steve Reeves ' career beyond those "" Hercules "" movies. However, despite the different costumes, it's still a "" Hercules "" movie with the usual stilted dialog, haphazard dubbing, and cardboard characters. On the other hand, there's lots of action, the pace rarely flags, and Reeves gets to do yet another one of those scenes where he's stripped to the waist, bound with ropes, and given a vigorous whipping which, needless to say, has little effect on his defiant character."
362,1,"I am surprised that so many comments about this film are positive. Having read the book several times ( and all the other historical novels by Mika Waltari) there is no way to say much good in this film. If I forget the origins of the story I might consider it a reasonably good epic. Of course to bring such a brick of a book to the big screen is a task not to be envied, but it could be done with class. I can't understand why even the name of Nefernefernefer had to be shortened to just Nefer. I love Peter Ustinov as Kaptah and Marlon Brando probably would have made a better Sinuhe but the overall attitude is too Hollywood to ever make justice to the book. Mind you Mika Waltari left the Premier of this film in the middle of the showing. That's how much he liked it."
369,1,"Spike Milligan was one of the funniest men I've ever seen, and a huge influence on my life. This movie is limp and awful, and does his memory no credit. The script is cluttered and preserves too many lines from the book intact ( the leg jokes here are incomprehensible). The actors ' performances are uniformly ineffective, a great cast wasted, and the lead, Sean Hughes, delivers Milligan's belligerent hostilities in a plaintive whine, which misses the point completely. The gentle pacing is a killer as well. Farce should accelerate towards the end. The Goon Shows often did, the novel "" Puckoon "" definitely did, but this film, if anything, slows down just when you want the various elements to smash together in a final climax. Milligan narrated an abridged audio recording of "" Puckoon "" in 1980, with T.P. McKenna, Dermot Kelly, Norma Ronald and Jack Hobbs. Now, that's funny. Ten minutes of that is funnier than this whole film. I believe the LP was transferred to CD, but don't know if it's still in print. There is a movie of "" Adolf Hitler: My Part in his Downfall "" with Jim Dale and Arthur Lowe. It too is a godawful mess, but it's funnier than this thing. It's possible that Milligan's spirit is too rambunctious for the screen. The other reviewers here are indulging in politeness and wishful thinking. This film fumbles virtually every opportunity and never misses a chance to disappoint."
388,1,"The horror. The film about the Nazisthe Germans. The murderers of babies, young girls rapists ... For that they regret? What are they interested in doing thousands of miles away from Germany? You do not come to mind is? Fascists are now good Samaritans? Think, killed, tortured, 27 million people. No, of course, they do not want. They were forced to Hitler, he gave each of them, and forced to kill: every fourth inhabitant of Belarus peace, all Jews, Gypsies ... Killing the Slavs. The facts: At the beginning of the Great Patriotic War, when taken prisoner by fascist ( German), they were defiant and brazen. We kill you all, and so on. Since 1943, when they were taken captive, they suddenly became antifascists and peaceful peasants who were forced to Hitler, and personally. For such films should be put to prison for life for the glorification of fascism.    If you want to see what they did, yet went to Stalingrad, then watch the movie "" Come and see "" ( 1985)."
417,1,"I saw the movie in original Italian. It must be said that the acting and interpretation is most heavily polluted by the TVgenerated trend to speak in a severely muffled voice, not moving lips, straining tones, as emerged in the "" That's real life""-productions and "" Let'sraiseour audiencewithafewtears""-screenplaywriting. The late Massimo Girotti towers upon the other characters for intensity, clarity of expression and intellectual honesty. The movie has some good hints, but ( as in another comment before mine) it lacks a focal point and dribbles away in many plotlets of lesser and lesser relevance, another trend dragged in from the TV productions, well known to Italians. A few drops in style could be spared to the public, such as the patisserie drag ( Charm and aesthetics of cooking plus sensual payload of sweets, see Chocolat, Babette's lunch, Vatel etc.) Hammam and the Fairies are definitely more truthful, seems that Ozpetek has learned the tune of Italy in the early 2000s and is humming along ... I'll give him a last chance though ..."
425,1,"The film is a remake of a 1956 BBC serial called'My Friend Charles ', & as such gallops thru the material in a relatively short time. I found it fast moving, enjoyable & unpretentious. Did anyone else notice the scenes, towards the end, where John Mills was being gassed?-the producers obviously decided to omit the scenesmaybe censorship?,but notice when he's sat by the window of the flat, deep breathing closely followed by similar scenes with the car window open. The Francis Durbridge serials all seemed to inhabit the same universe, that of unexplained happenings, people being not what they seem & the villain being someone close to the hero/ victim. A predictable universe in some ways, but one with its own rules & regulations."
431,1,"Danny is beyond sorry. He keeps making the same mistakes, and is no longer interesting to watch. At first I could feel for him, as an addict myself. My heart went out to him at the beginning, and somewhere along the line he went over the line. It is almost as if he is continuing this behavior to keep the show going, and at the same time is seriously risking his life, and the welfare of his family, especially his children. It is difficult even to have pity for the poor boy. I think he needs to watch this show, maybe then he might have a chance a saving this marriage. I can't understand how Gretchen stays with him, and I keep wondering how much is just for show, and how much is love. Danny, get a lifea new one that is! ... and don't get me started on Dr. Gary. What is with him and his face? His skin looks like it's stretched to the max. Besides that, looks don't mean a thing, yet he seems not to be particularly impartial. I think, he too, is keeping this going for his own monetary gain and often not in the best interests of either Gretchen or Danny. These people are few confused and each remind me of a dog chasing its tail. sad, very sad. C'mon pull yourselves together."
438,1,"I just saw this at SIFF, and I absolutely loved it. There were parts where I laughed so hard I couldn't catch my breath. The script and direction by Glenn McQuaid are fantastic. I can't wait to see more from this talented young man. The performances make the movie. Larry Fessenden and Dominic Monaghan are just delightful as the graverobber Willy and his apprentice Arthur. Ron Perlman turns in a fantastic performance ( as usual) as a lessthansympathetic jailhouse priest. Bonus: Angus Scrimm as an unscrupulous doctor! As always, he balances menace and humor perfectly. This is a style of horror comedy that really hasn't been seen since Vincent Price did "" Comedy of Terrors, "" "" The Raven, "" and "" Theater of Blood. "" The movie is genuinely scary in places, then it'll suddenly flip back into hilarious mode, keeping you totally off balance. Some parts are scary and funny at the same time. I can only afford to see three movies at SIFF this year, but even if the other two are awful, "" I Sell The Dead "" was worth the price of all three. I'm going to be looking for more movies from Larry Fessenden's Glass Eye Pix. He's giving the horror genre a muchneeded kick in the butt."
447,1,"Although Humphrey Bogart got star billing in King Of The Underworld, I'm willing to bet he didn't thank Jack Warner for it. In fact this film was one hollow crown. King of the Underworld was supposedly a remake of the Paul Muni film, Dr. Socrates, but given Humphrey Bogart was in the cast, the character is written more like Duke Mantee in The Petrified Forest. He even has an English writer along in the person of James Stephenson. Kay Francis and John Eldredge are a pair of married doctors and Eldredge pulls off a tricky bit of surgery on one of Bogart's henchmen. Bogey's a man who appreciates good work done on his behalf and gives Eldredge$ 500.00 and there's more where that came from if he plays his cards right. Eldredge who has a gambling problem sees a good way to get some undeclared income.    But when he's killed in a raid on the gang's hideout, Francis is also thought to be involved by the law and the American Medical Association no matter how much she protests her innocence. It's no good and she and her aunt Jessie Busley move to a small town to get away from the notoriety. Of course the notoriety and Bogart and an itinerant Leslie Howard like writer in Stephenson all meet up with her again. But Kay is plucky and resourceful to say the least. Bogart's character was ridiculous, no wonder the poor guy was screaming for better parts. He's a gangster who both shoots down people without mercy and gives his henchmen hotfoots just for laughs. He's concerned about his image and therefore kidnaps writer Stephenson to ghost write his autobiography and of course confesses enough to burn him in all 48 states. And then let's Kay Francis completely outsmart him, hard to believe he was king of anything. Definitely one of the lesser works for either of the stars."
449,1,"Following his role in the fine caper SEVEN THIEVES ( 1960)    which I ve watched several years back    Edward G. Robinson seemed to be stuck playing elderly criminal mastermind types ( apart from the odd juicy role as in THE CINCINNATI KID [ 1965 ]). I d previously watched the pretty good EuroCult effort GRAND SLAM ( 1967) and, apart from this, I ve yet two more similar titles from Italy to check    one of which was directed by future goremeister Lucio Fulci! Anyway, this is the kind of international production    featuring American and Italian actors and a British director    which was prevalent during the 1960s; its harmless and easygoing in itself but hardly memorable and definitely overlong    especially since to procure finance for the heavyduty equipment required for the heist ( such as an army tank and an airplane!), the gang involved have to pull a variety of minor thefts first. The gang, of course, is an incompetent lot led by an American ( Robert Wagner) and his bimbo girlfriend ( Raquel Welch)    the others are a pacifist black man, a perennially hungry Italian and a diminutive Englishman. They try to induce an exgangster ( Vittorio De Sica) to turn over his fortune to them, except he s destitutebut, under the auspices of Professor Robinson, he proposes instead a caper of 5 million dollars worth of platinum! Needless to say, the gang members do nt trust one another ( Wagner instructs Welch to seduce De Sica so as to get the name of their fence in Morocco    where they are to retreat after the robbery), or else bungle the job ( commissioned to hold up a restaurant, the Italian ca nt resist sitting at table and order a multicourse meal for himself!). Amusingly, in the face of similar failures, De Sica tries to show them how they used to do it in the old days    however, ostensibly holding up a petrol station, it transpires that the owner is a nephew of his and he merely asked to borrow some cash!    The central heist sequence is typically elaborate: while the gang, including Welch, take the train transporting the platinum, Wagner kidnaps pilot Victor Spinetti and his airplane. When the job is done, he fully intends to doublecross De Sica    but neither his partners nor Welch herself are willing to go along with this, so he s forced to relent. Coming from the time when crime did nt pay, the gang contrives to lose all their stash in midair when the planes bombbay doors are accidentally opened"
453,1,"First off, to rent or watch this film you are expecting something in the Bhorror range. What this film delivers for the astute fan of this genre is quite a hilarious romp via nordic flavor. At times reminding me of the humor of Jackson's Dead Alive and others of a Stuart Gordon flick this little find should have most chuckling throughout.    The f/ x reach a few highs of truly spooky ( the first time Ed meets his nemesis) but generally have the feel that this film was put together by a f/ x team that decided to use any and all props at their disposal from other films ... gremlins, devils, slasher films, etc. to pretty good effect and worked in thru the use of hallucinations.    The gem of the film is the humor. The gore works most of the time but more for laughs. At its heart its a parody and a fun one at that."
459,1,"If there's one word I can associate to this movie, its ' embarrassment '. It must be embarrassing to everyone associated with the movie, to actually watch it in a theatre. Everythingthe script, screenplay, dialogues, song lyrics, directionshoddy, lousy. Saw this movie when I was a kid. Liked it then, mainly because it was a fantasy, a superheromovie. Its a notsoexplored genre in Hindi cinema. The attempt deserves credit, but that's all there is to it. Sashi Kapoor seems to have been in a great hurry in making the movie. Can't understand the reason behind casting foreigners as Hindispeaking characters, who can't even get the sync right ( nothing to say about the dubbing). The screenplay is terrible. The editing even more. If one follows the dialogues closely, one can detect grammaticallywrong sentences ( which completely alter the intended meaning). Nothing special about the music. The biggest embarrassment must be for the Censor board. There are a couple of nipslip scenes in the movie, one of which is absolutely clear ( so much so that I can't even think of a metaphor). The director missed them. The editing team missed it. And the censor board missed it too. So much for the noindecentexposureon screen motto. The officials probably fell asleep while watching the movie. Can't think of why Amitabh went with the role. It might be because he was a good friend of the Kapoors. But the role hardly has anything for him. With wonderful roles in Hum and Agneepath behind him, he couldn't have followed it up with a worse one. There are a couple of heroic scenes, really worthy ones. But otherwise, they're embarrassingly unbelievable ( arrowcatching for instance .. it probably could've been better with CGI, but it was ' 91 ..). Dimple and Sonam do not exactly set the screen on fire. Shammi Kapoor and Rishi Kapoor give an inspired performance, but their scope is limited. Amrish Puri is his usual self in the role of a fairytale villain ( letting out the villainous laugh every now and then). On the whole, an interesting concept. Could have been a lot more better."
492,1,"A sadly predictable, clichd story about a woman who was no better than she should have been. Sadly, too, the screenplay is by the oncegreat experimental novelist John Dos Passos, from an original by French exotic potboiler Pierre Louys. This time Marlene Dietrich is Concha, a manipulative, coldhearted Spanish beauty. Don Pasqual ( Lionel Atwill) raises her from the cigarette factory, but she ditches him. He warns his tall young friend Antonio ( Cesar Romero) against her, but to no avail. A duel ensues, Concha reproaches Pasqualito for trying to kill the only man she ever cared for, so he doesn't: he points his pistol at the sky, but Antonio shoots him. But instead of going off to Paris with the young victor, she goes back to the man who would have died for her. With an unexpected bit by Edward Everett Horton as a Spanish Governor. Dietrich plays the part of a Spanish woman by moving constantly, twisting at the waist and posturing and then twisting back, flouncing, tossing her head, and so forth. And she makes faces, and has a curl in the middle of her forehead. The photography is strangely crowded: no outdoor scene can be shot except through a tangle of bare trees, no interior scene can be shot without so much busy detail that it's almost impossible to follow people moving across a room, no consecutive scene of Dietrich can be shot without a major wardrobe change. The carnival scenes are so full of confetti and streamers it's almost like an underwater scene in the Sargasso Sea."
496,1,"It's a unique film, as it gives us our only chance to see the young Noel Coward in all his ironic glory. Because he seems so reserved & detached he's perfect for the role of an unloved cad who matteroffactly uses all those around him. However in the deadly serious ( no pun intended) last act, when Coward must make like the Flying Dutchman, he's much less comfortable. But his way with an epigram is peerless, and Hecht & Macarthur have given him some gems ( Macarthur, really -- he was the wit of the pair). The film is superbly lighted by the great Lee Garmes, but has little camera movement aside from a storm sequence. Hecht and Macarthutr cared about one thing -- getting their dialogue on screen. ( NOTE: H&M themselves have blinkandyou'llmiss-'em cameos as bums in the flophouse scene). The most notable supporting player is the one and only Alexander Woolcott, notorious Broadway columnist and close friend of both Macarthur and Coward, who appears as one of the bitchy authors always kept waiting in the reception room of publisher Coward. Curious that Woolcott would agree to do a film that clearly lampoons the legendary Algonquin Round Table, of which he was a founder, and Macarthur something of an auxiliary member. The Scoundrel actually won an Oscar for best story, though that victory is probably due more to Coward's imposing presence than any brilliance in the plot. It's Coward, Woolcott, and the dialogue you remember ..."

524,1,"The best bit in the film was when Alan pulled down her knickers and ran the cut throat razor over her bum cheeks and around her bum hole. It was also brilliant to see Alan's bum going up and down like a fiddler's elbow later on in the film. Alan was tough as hell in it like when he got annoyed and pushed the four eyed wimp onto the sofa. I've been laughing for days about the cut throat razor bit. A brilliant idea by the script writers. Alan must be brought back into Eastenders so he can do the same to Peggy. Alan is back, and this time he's armed with a razor. Watch out if you're a girl and he finds you and pulls your knickers down."
543,1,"I've read all the Dave Robicheaux novels and consider James Lee Burke to be my favorite contemporary fiction writer. I've also visited New Iberia and much of Acadiana to be able to better visualize the setting in most of these books. Needless to say, I greatly anticipated seeing "" In the Electric Mist, "" especially since I thought Tommy Lee Jones would be terrific as Robicheaux. I was greatly disappointed. The story was very choppy; the interplay with the "" ghosts of Confederate dead "" was shallow and lost the impact and nobility it added to the book; and Tommy Lee Jones was doleful, expressionless and difficult to understand as DR. The best way to describe this forgettable film is to add my "" ditto "" to an earlier user comment that this movie was like one of those old madeforTV movies. I expected Jill St. John or Cameron Mitchell to show up at any time. The location settings were accurate, and the photography at times captured the essence of the steamy bayous, smoky juke joints and eerie aboveground graveyards of South Louisiana. Too bad the story's disjointed presentation and Tommy Lee's subpar performance interfered with the unique mood and spicy zest of the region. Next to final comment: In the novels, Dave Robicheaux's nickname is "" Streak, "" because of the distinct streak of silvergray hair on one side of his head. ( Similar to how the Sopranos ' Paulie Walnuts would appear if he were seen only in profile.) Tommy Lee had no such streak in this film, probably because the editors are James Lee Burke fans and they airbrushed the streak out after witnessing Mr. Jones's poor imitation of Dave Robicheaux. Final comment: While I generally find Alec Baldwin to be pompous and obnoxious in most roles, he was by far a better Robicheaux in "" Heaven's Prisoners "" than Tommy Lee was in "" In the Electric Mist. "" Also, Heaven's Prisoners is much more interesting and exciting, with uniformly believable performances and more evocative atmosphere than this new movie. "" In the Electric Mist "" is okay to watch when one feels like "" veging out "" and there's nothing better on TV. But then, so are infomercials."

553,1,"I have noticed that a lot of films that have been featured on "" Mystery Science Theater "" have received a tons of low ratings on IMDb. However, a few of the films featured on the films weren't that bad and it's not fair to rate a film that's been given the "" MST "" treatment -- with the hosts making funny comments during the film. Now I am NOT saying that "" The Girl in Lover's Lane "" is a great film, but it's not nearly bad enough to merit its current IMDb score of 2.1. The film begins with Bix and Danny meeting. Bix is a veteran drifter and Danny a younger guy who seems to have no particular reason to be wandering about the country. Once they blow into a small town, Bix needs to rescue Danny again and again because Danny is quite naive -- a nice way of saying he has the intellect of a tomato. Along the way, something happens to the selfassured Bix -- he finds a nice young lady and finds the lure of staying put pulling at him. And, in an odd subplot, Jack Elam plays a supercreepy sicko who wanders the town scaring the crap out of everyone -- yet oddly, the police don't seem to take much notice nor does anyone on their own do anything about him. Ultimately, however, when Elam puts the moves on a girl who Bix is falling for, things come to a full boil. Overall, while not at all a great film, there were many interesting plot elements in this film -- enough to merit a score higher than 2.1. The biggest negatives are a simplistic conclusion to the mystery that occurs near the end as well as the total stupidity of Danny one time too often. Considering the minuscule budget, however, it's a watchable little film."
575,1,"On a Clear Day You Can See Forever is nothing more than a New Age update of the "" Pygmalion ""/ "" My Fair Lady "" story: A professor attempts to turn a common girl into an upper society woman. This time, however, instead of using language skills, the professor tries to do so by hypnotism and past life regression. You know a musical has problems when reviewers constantly mention the sets and the costumes before they mention the plot and the music. The songs are instantly forgettable. ( No "" Get Me to the Church on Time "" here, I'm afraid.) And the plot goes nowhere. To paraphrase Gertrude Stein, there is no "" there "" here. The characters wander through the story without ever getting from point A to point B. Professor Chabot claims several times that he will get to the root of Daisy's troubles, but he never seems to do so. All meaningful conflict is avoided. For instance, there comes a time when Chabot's university demands he either stop his research into reincarnation or resign his position. Now there is conflict! Will he give up his career for Daisy? Alas! Nothing comes of this development. A scene or two later the university changes its mind and tells Chabot to continue on with his work. So much for conflict. The talent was certainly assembled for this movie: Directed by Vincente Minnelli. Written, in part, by Alan Jay Lerner. A cast of Yves Montand, Bob Newhart and Jack Nicholson. And, oh yes, starring Barabara Striesand who was nearly at the top of her game at this point in her career. But it all falls flat. Lerner's attempt to reincarnate his greatest success, the previously mentioned "" My Fair Lady, "" is as doomed to failure as Daisy's attempt to revive the greatness of her own past. If you enjoy movie musicals, there are far better choices than this."
580,1,"This could have been great. The voiceovers are exactly right and fit the characters to a T. One small problem though; the look of the characters, mostly the supporting or guest characters look exactly the same. The same bored look on every face only with minor changes such as hairlines or weight size. It looks kind of odd to see a really big guest star's voice coming out of a lifeless form like the characters here. If I am not mistaken Kathy Griffin did a voiceover for this show and it looked too odd to be funny. There is a few other problems, one being the family plot. The Simpsons did it much better where you could actually buy most of the situations the characters got themselves into. Here we get too much annoying diversions, like someone having a weird fantasy and then we are supposed to find that funny but for some reason the delivery is a bit off. As you can probably tell it is hard for me to put a finger on exactly what is wrong with this show because it basically nothing more than a clone of the Simpsons or even more "" Married with Children "". If I should point a finger on what is totally wrong with this it probably is it's repetitiveness. Peter Griffin is not really a bright character but neither are any of the others. Lois should have been named Lois Lame because she is sort of onedimensional. Seth Green as the kind of retarded son is the best thing about this show and that is the most stereotypical part on the show. So what more can I say. There isn't exactly anything wrong with this show but in the long run you have to admit that it takes a lot of work to do what the Simpsons has done for almost two decades."
585,1,"Excellent Hitchcock thriller with Robert Cummings proving once again that he could really act up a storm. This time he is a defense plant worker caught up in a horrible plot when his best friend is killed at the plant. Priscilla Lane is the girl who suddenly becomes interested in Cummings as the plot thickens and he is pursued from California to N.Y. There is a diabolical plot by a group of wealthy 5th columnists to destroy from from within. Hitchcock was known to play up the upper echelons of society involved in mayhem in his long career as a director. Ironically, the film implodes at the very end. While we see what happens to the guy who killed Cummings ' friend, we don't see what happens to the rest of the gang, again, many of whom represent the upper crust of society."

603,1,"Average adventure movie that took a serious story and "" Holywoodised "" it. The watering down effect done particularly towards the average script snatched away this movie's place as a would be solid classic. Why water down such a great storyline?Probably because it deals with "" sensitive "" colonial subject matters and the producers do not want to create political heat, just quick profits thank you. The directing, cinematography and soundtrack and acting was good. The screenplay was average. The charm of Connery made up for his wrong Arabic accent and all the scenes with President T. Roosevelt were masterpiece takes. The costumes/ sets here was very good. Too bad we did not get more of a serious historical drama since this is what the story demands. Only for big fans of the lead actors or fans of exotic Romance/ Adventure Holywood movies ....."
606,1,"I thought this movie was really good. It ends up showing the viewers in the end that Leila should of kept what she had. Leila was sick of her husband Jim, who was more worried about work then her. He was so into his work that he forgot their anniversary. He was also very sloppy. She couldn't take it anymore so she left to see if he would miss her. The movie shows that he misses her, he even tries to make up for the night he messed up. He goes to her and tries to bring her home. She ends up finding another man named Schuyler. He seemed like the man she always wanted neat and notices her. In the end she sorta foreshadows by when she look at Schuylers shoes and the way he let his cigar ashes fall on the floor the way Jim did the same kinda thing. Jim ends off making lots of money and cleaning himself up. Leila thinks in the end that she should of kept her husband because that s all she really wanted and he did changing."
640,1,"I had borrowed the three Sarah movies from a friend, and had watched them while sick in bed during one weekend. I thoroughly enjoyed every one of them. I enjoyed how the last movie gave a glimpse of what Caleb and his sister were like when they grew up. In addition, I liked the carrythrough of the "" Billyboy "" song that first was heard during the credits of the first movie, the title "" Sarah, Plain and Tall. "" However, the one thing in Winter's End that I didn't like was the youngest daughter. She was a very cute little girl, but she just had too much spirit and looked like a brat compared to the other kids, even compared to talkative but still goodnatured Caleb when he was younger."
681,1,"It's common knowledge and has been said before: No one can ever play Scarlett and Rhett like Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable. Joanne Whalley Kilmer ( no longer Kilmer having been divorced from exhubby Val Kilmer) plays her own Scarlett and although this is a sequel and not a remake ( Godforbid!!!) she still can not rise to the occasion ( i.e. her voice sounds evil on several occasions, she's got brown eyes [ Scarlett in both novels had green eyes and even Vivien Leigh's eyes were green ] and her vocal power was not up to the job either. Scarlett is a Southern Belle; therefore she has an incredible talent for flirting ( as she did in SCARLETT the novel and GWTW, of course) and to be a great flirt like Scarlett is, you would most likely need a higherpitched voice, like Vivien Leigh.    I suppose I'm comparing Kilmer to Leigh a bit too much but when someone possesses a role so masterfully as Leigh did with Scarlett you simply can't help but to criticize any new prospective Scarletts. Timothy Dalton should have had no accent whatsoever, due to the fact that both Margaret Mitchell's Rhett and Gable in the film had none. His acting has never been truly noteworthy ( except, maybe his portrayal of the evil, conniving King Phillip of France in THE LION IN WINTER) and he gives very little ( if any) freshness or vitality to his Rhett.     Standouts in the cast are most notably Tina Kellagher ( a born actress with plenty of authenticity in her deliverance) as the tragic victim Mary Boyle. And then of course there's Sean Bean as the cold, calculating and not to mention, almost demonically evil Lord Fenton, Mary's nemesis and Scarlett's eventual violator. One thing I could not forgive the writer for was the fact that Scarlett is raped in this movie ( a fact that never occurred in the novel; Lord Fenton is cold and of illrepute among the Irish in the book but he's nowhere near as heartless as his screen counterpart. Another omission from the novel but readded for the film is the character of Belle Watling, played most horribly by AnnMargret in a cameo role, which we all could have lived without, seeing as how the book was such a runaway bestseller without requiring any assistance from Ms. Watling.    For a film by itself, SCARLETT is a very good one but not quite in that lofty of a place in terms of being GONE WITH THE WINDs sequel. Another actress was highly necessary for Scarlett as well as Rhett."
684,1,"Robin Williams is a national treasure, specially when he cuts loose and puts aside his maudlin approach to drama. He manages to liven up the usual restrained pacing of Barry Levinson, and there are moments in this film when he truly shines. As the funny elected American president in "" Man of The Year "" Williams recaptures the hilarity and outrageousness that used to be associated with him. What makes him so appealing is his humanity and likability. Here is a man who can lash at his audience but truly loves them, too. His humour is like barbed wire, and yet it is cathartic. It is what makes him very appealing to the people in the film and in real life. Laura Linney is once again portraying an intelligent woman in distress. She is a fabulous and very talented performer, but I think she has boxed into a stereotype and unfortunately, it would have been more interesting to have a less recognizable performer in this case. Walken pretty much walks through his thankless role, and the climatic scene in the SNL skit barely floats above water. Go in for a few hilarious moments, and those are priceless. Enjoy Williams and forget some of the deep moments that slow down this otherwise entertaining movie."
693,1,"I was looking forward to seeing this movie, unfortunately I should have listened to my daughters advice. This should have been a spoof, but it took on a realism that corporations had a lot to answer for. Jim Carrey after all the work he has done is still Jim Carrey and his comedy does not get any better, his co star was not able to back him up. Their son in the movie was invisible. The life of crime was a blink, and that was the missing link of the movie. The film showed 2 or 3 robberies and they were richer than before, that where it lost it for me. I did laugh in some parts butthrough the whole not good enough, AlecBaldwin I felt was there to add some weight to the film. His character was not strong enough. There were just too many gaps to make this a smart and tight movie."
702,1,"Chris Ricci sleepwalks her way through most of this, but then quickly takes on an air of boredom and disdainmuch as I did when watching it. Without her this would be no more than a cheap kids ' movie, but at least she does add an air of quality. There are few, if any, more visually striking and charismatic young actresses in the business. There's not much wrong with it as long as you accept it for what it isa cheap Disney remake aimed at very undemanding children. I could watch Ricci all day so I'm probably oblivious to many of the movie's shortcomings, but unless you too are a Ricci fan, a catlover, or very small child, I doubt you will find this very entertaining."
718,1,"( Warning: spoilers! -- although it's hard to spoil this film by telling story details.) Eisenstein's black and white propaganda film is not for everyone. It's very old and it's, er, clumsy. What makes it great for me is the soundtrack, not the original but the updated soundtrack. Better still, the orchestral version Prokofiev created ( my favorite performance is by Fritz Reiner and the Chicago Symphony). The film is actually funny in places. It's reminiscent of the old "" Midsummer Night's Dream "". Some of the outdoor scenes are quite magnificent. Some of the actors are also quite magnificent. ( The actor who played Nevsky could have been a superstar today. Ditto for the warrior chick, Vasilisa -- definitely a rocker.)    This may be the world's best collection, on film, of pithy Russian sayings ( there are tons of them -- they make up the bulk of the spoken lines). The battle scenes actually look much more realistic than most highbudget Hollywood flix. These guys are as clumsy with their fighting as real peasants would be. The weapons look nasty, so the actors were probably trying to avoid actually wounding one another. The actor playing the German "" grand marshall "" is trying* really* hard to look scary early in the film, but he looks like he was really a pussycat. After he's captured he looks* so* pathetic. ( Speaks volumes about the intended audience, da?) A really humorous touch is that the German army brings an* organ* with it, played by a character in a black robe. Watch the Russians bring this guy down* while* he's playing. After the battle is over and almost all of the Germans are dead comes the best part of the film ( and the music), the song sung to the dead soldiers who've died defending the motherland. This part is so sad it's almost an antiwar statement. Ten times as many men as ladies have rated this film. Wonder why? Warning: Joseph Stalin liked this film. Ironic -- he killed more Russians than anybody. "" Those who come to Russia carrying a sword will die by the sword ""."
721,1,"I saw this fine flick shortly leaving college. As I sat there happily watching Alice go from repressed virgin to sexual adventurer, I got to wondering why her sexual encounters seemed familiar. Then I remembered-- Intro Psych 101 Lecture! One of the lectures dealt with the PsychoSexual Stages of Developement, basically the shift over time on what part of the body and its attendant stimulations gets our main attention, as well as the changing emphasis on what gives us pleasure. Alice's first encounter is being bathed, with emphasis on the genitals and bottom. Her next encounter is an oral one with the Mad Hatter's dingaling. I forget the rest of the lecture and the order of Alice's encounters, but I do remember how well they matched. It's interesting to see a skin flick with some brains behind it, rather than the cliche "" I'm here to deliver your pizza. Let's screw. "" I don't see how Kristin DeBell's career could be wrecked by this film, as it was her first film. And Reagan's tiresome hypocrisies had yet to mar this land when it was released, but in a way he and his stooge Meese did affect Ms DeBell. When Meese was staging his antipornography commission ( to distract people from his own criminal activities), Meese hired the services of an antiporn activist named Judith Reisner. Reisner was obsessed with images she perceived as child pornography. She saw the "" Alice "" cover Ms DeBell did for Playboy and promptly announced she had scientifically proven that Ms DeBell was in fact a photo collage of parts from several grown women and the face of a ten year old. Yeah, right ...."
744,1,"A cut above from the usual straight to video actioneer, Airborne has enough in the tank to keep it going for the full 90 minutes, although you can't help but think of how low former ' 80's comedy golden boy Steve Guttenburg has stooped to be in such a cheap production ( and playing a hard man too!). The plot is simple, the baddies have stolen a deadly virus and Guttenburg and the rest of his goodie pals are sent to retrieve it, Not bad of its kind but not in the same league ( obviously) as the films it is compared too on the cover such as AIR FORCE ONE and CON AIR. The cast is good though, with Sean Bean reprising his Brit.-bad guy character which we have had a glimpse of in such box office smashes as GOLDENEYE and PATRIOT GAMES."
764,1,"Jack Bender's "" The Tempest "" is an adaption of Shakespeare's play "" The Tempest "". Bender transports the plot from medieval Italy to Mississippi during the time of the American civil war. He includes the slavery problem and the role of revenge in wartimes. Prospero, renamed Gideon Prosper is not the Duke of Milan but a landowner in Mississippi. He learns voodoo magic from the female slave Mambo Azaleigh. He saves her son Ariel, who thus accompanies him into his exile. The island is not situated on the sea but in a swamp near the banks of the Mississippi. There lives an Alligator hunter, a socalled "" GatorMan "", who later tries to rape Prospero's daughter Miranda. During the time of the civil war, Ariel wants to join the Union troops to help fighting against slavery. Prospero does not care about the war. He is only interested in his personal revenge on his brother Antony. When Antony and his bookkeeper Willi Gonzo ( Gonzalo) try to cross the river, Prospero raises a storm. The Union soldier Frederick gets lost in the swamp and finally comes to the island. He and Miranda fall in love with each other but Prospero won't accept that. Meanwhile, Ariel transformed into a raven by Prospero, finds out that Antony has feigned to ally with the Union but plans to betray them. Antony and Gonzo meet Gator Man in the swamp and conspire with him against Prospero. They kidnap Miranda and Ariel but Prospero freeze them and helps the Union defeat the Southern army. In the end Ariel is free, Frederick and Miranda are bound to marry, Prospero returns to the plantation and Gator Man gets back the island. Peter Fonda represents Gideon Prosper powerfully and convincingly while the character of Antony stays rather flat. It was no bad idea to perform the Tempest before the background of the civil war but perhaps the director has risked too much. In some parts the story seems constructed or comical. Gator Man for example does just appear without any explanation. That it needs a kidnapping to bring Prospero to his mind and that he loses confidence in his power shows that Bender tried to make Prospero more human but only made him a weak old man without his magic. Prospero's original authority and wisdom is not made clear. -------------End of Part 1--------------------------"
774,1,"This was the first directing job by Sebastian Gutierrez, the writer of Snakes on a Plane and Gothika. Anyone who has read my reviews knows that I love capers, and this was a doozy. A kidnapping and a woman shot in the process. The FBI has Emma Thompson on the kidnapping case and the Police Chief ( Roscoe Lee Browne) assigns Alan Rickman to solve the murder, which happens to be a Senator's ( Hal Holbrook) wife. These two make an outstanding pair as they work together. The kidnappers/ murderers have lovers Simon Baker ( Land of the Dead) and the ultra hot Carla Gugino ( Sin City), along with a couple of partners. They kidnapped a hotshot computer mogul and they run his accountant all over town before they get the dough. Things go fast from there as new twists and turns are brought in. The whole thing is brilliant and definitely a "" piss in your pants because you can't go to the bathroom or you'll miss something "" thrill. Now, to be completely honest, I would have given this movie a 10 if there had been more of the movie the security guard was watching in the opening. I would have loved to see more of Beverly Hotsprings and Yvette Lera, but, hey, that wasn't part of the caper; just icing on the cake. Thompson and Rickman should definitely make more movies together. One treat: Agent Hawkins: So fill me in. Detective Friedman: That remark could be misconstrued as sexual harassment, Agent Hawkins. Agent Hawkins: Let's get it out of the way then: you've never worked under a female superior before. I got to where I am by pushing paper and playing niceI've never actually fired a gun before, I'm only in this job to prove to my father I'm not a coward. I give decent head, so I got promoted before all the worthy candidates, all of them men, all of them equally gifted at fellatio but there was a gender quota to fill. I'm also stupid and idealistic; you are hard and cynical, and usually right. I am secretly in love with you but I have a hard time showing it. Did I skip anything? Damn, that's great dialog! Gutierrez not only directs a great movie, but he can write too! And, did I say Carla Gugino was hot? Put this on your list."
823,1,"I'm not going to tell anyone what happens in the end, but it did not fit with the movie. The rest of Imaginary Heroes, though, portrayed a realistic family going through realistic issues, such as death, drugs, relationships, and high school. I could have sworn that they were my own family, no joke. Emile Hirsch was completely believable as a teen struggling with his brother's suicide, and Sigourney Weaver plays a mother trying to keep the remains of her ( slightly) dysfunctional family together. Although this family may take their issues to the extreme, anyone can relate to what they go through, whether it be graduation, living up to expectations, or being a parent."
859,1,"Imagine watching a slide show where the projector lingers on every slide long enough for you to completely memorize it three times over. Now imagine that the images in the slide show consist entirely of mundane scenes    a small park; and empty tennis court; a piano. Now imagine that the people running the slide show are having a frustratingly slow, semilucid conversation about events that only occasionally relate to the slides they're showing you. Great    you've just imagined the entirety of the film` India Song. ' The film is an agonizingly slow montage of images that do little except to simply scream out` Look at me! I am PROFOUND!! ' with such blatant selfimportance that the images themselves and the movie as a whole are rendered not merely bereft of profundity, but COMICALLY bereft of profundity. The visuals could easily have been replaced by a series of static images as described above, since it is so rare that there are actually people on screen, and even when they are, the people actually move only slightly more often than the furniture. They never speak or interact in any meaningful way    they just stand there looking at each other, and occasionally crying. The most energetic moment in the entire first hour of the film is when three people walk across a parking lot in slow motion. In fact, the visuals could easily have been left out entirely, as the story is told completely through narration. The story is about a woman who hates India because it's hot, and hates people don't hate India because it's hot ( this point is covered several times). It is also about a man who feels that he is entitled to sleep with the aforementioned woman, since she will sleep with anyone who asks her to, but he doesn't get to sleep with her simply because he never asks, and he's very upset about this. So he stares at her as a single tear runs profoundly down his cheek. Later on, he stares at his bicycle, as a single tear runs profoundly down his cheek. Actually, you don't get to see the single tear running profoundly down his cheek when he's staring at his bicycle, but you know it's there anyway, just because that's the sort of film this is. At best, the narration becomes background hum, serving as a perfect compliment to the comainducing visuals. Simply staying conscious through the entirety of this film would require a supreme act of determination. To watch it and actually come away with a serious and meaningful idea of what it was supposed to be about would induce the same sort of migraine as trying to read lengthy technical documents in the dark. This film is perhaps the greatest monument of pseudoartistic pretension that man will ever know."
928,1,"This is one of those strange, selfimportant, selfindulgent movies which tries too hard to be profound. It isn't. Instead, it spouts cliches that try to pass for Profundity. Typical is the scene where Peter ( Kelsey Grammer) explains to protagonist and best friend Adam ( Dwier Brown) how man starts life breast feeding, then moves on to sucking the breast of his girlfriend, and finally his wife, thus concluding ultimately that life sucks. So deep. We are treated to a variety of characters who offer their perspective of life, the universe, etc. during Adam's travels through the Mojave Desert on foot. ( He abruptly leaves L.A. the day of his wedding and his family, friends, and fiance assume he's dead when his car was found in a military test range smashed by a rocket.) Some characters are more entertaining than others. The best by far is an escapee from a mental hospital who only speaks through the voices of others. The actor, James Kevin Ward, does some great impressions, including Nicholson, Popeye, and several characters from the original Star Trek. But once the interesting characters leave the screen, we're stuck with Adam again and his pursuit of the profound. It's a long trip, which drags in many places. In fact, it's the longest hour and a half movie I've ever seen. And the finale hardly makes it seem worth while, at all. I discovered this movie playing on HBO one day by waking up too early and clicking on the TV. That'll learn me. Next time I'll try harder to sleep in."
945,1,"Thomas Edison had no other reason to make this film except to show that film can capture the electrocution of an innocent elephant. Edison was not a genius but a man out for money and profit; his love for life was measured by dollars, not experiences, as this film shows."
955,1,"This is about as pretentious a movie as a shallow director like Joel Schumacher could make, I suppose. A group of medical students take it turns to die for several minutes; upon revival they discover that their sins have manifested themselves somehow or other. As some of the characters are visited by dead people and some just seem to be haunted by their guilty consciences it's not quite clear exactly what the connection is, but the visions do all seem to look like sixth form art films. Why the students treat their experiment as some kind of grand journey that'll make them famous is a bit of a mystery, as the results are completely unproveable and, as the movie mentions several times, have been documented plenty of times before. Still, it's nice to see Schumacher practising for his Batman trainwrecks with a bit of the old neon paint and coloured lightbulbs. And William Baldwin is a plank."
1049,1,"Tarzan, the environmental awareness leader, faces four trappers who by most unorthodox means abduct animals to get them to Zoos. Tarzan has a bland but sexy enough wife with an impeccable hairdo, and a kid. No one should fault Tarzan for being grieved by the vicious actions of the hunters. This Gordon Scott Tarzan flick is one of the silliest, completely and unnecessarily silly; for one reason or another, the team did not find anything charming to sustain the movie, and so it's just some silly rubbish. Tarzan and his family are threatened by a group of evil trappers, because Tarzan's environmental awareness brought him into open conflict with the evildoers. The kid and the chimpanzee, both belonging to Tarzan, are kidnapped by the malevolent trappers; so Tarzan summons the unleashed animal forces of the jungle to release the kid and the chimp with Tarzan leading the attack. TARZAN AND THE TRAPPERS is silly, unappealing, quite uninteresting. Maybe as a kid I would have liked it? Now one has to be too mean as viciously mean as those pathetic trappers punished by Tarzan to ask a Tarzan flick not to be silly; this I concede. But one is also truly entitled to ask these Tarzan flicks, however silly, to have and to show some gusto a bit of gusto even a tiny bit of gusto. Some kick, some excitement, some fun. Now the Gordon Scott Tarzan failure is too silly exactly in the sense of not having any gusto at all, of lacking all excitement. ( Yes, I liked the sequence of the jungle beast eating a snake. What beast? Watch the movie, kiddos, now here I just gave you one excuse to do so.) For one reason or another, the villains look somewhat pathetic and elicit mercy rather than virtuous anger. The books leave the impression that Tarzan seemed quite bright in his own way; and if finding a decent bodybuilder or another sportsman to look clever enough for the role might prove a too demanding, next to impossible task, Gordon Scott was anyway too far from meeting that ideal. The wife chides Tarzan for disliking books. The script suggests Tarzan was uneducated, almost illiterate, and adverse to learning; but the book says otherwise, and we know that Tarzan studied much, by himself, using the books of his gone family, before even meeting white people. And I did not like that yell. ( It's supposed, dear kiddos, to be a genuine wild yell, not a missed yodeler.)"
1068,1,"Some people don't appreciate the magical elements in ROS, but they are what sets this series apart, that and the fact the producers actually decided to dress the actors in proper period clothes and armour -- not anachronistic feathered caps, multicoloured tights and plate armour! But I am really writing to comment on an earlier poster's article. Um, Michael Praed did not leave ROS to do Jules Verne! There are 15 years between these two series. Yup, I agree and Michael might well agree too that leaving ROS was not a good move -- but it was a coveted Broadway role that tempted him in ' 84 and then Dynasty with its megabucks paychecks ...."
1087,1,"Perry Mason: The Case of the Glass Coffin finds Raymond Burr defending David Copperfield/ Rick Blaine like magician Peter Scolari from a murder charge involving one of his assistants. A trick involving a suspended glass coffin in midair goes awry and the body of Nancy Grahn comes a tumbling out. Nancy was one of six female assistants who work with the act and we learn two things about her. First in a moment of drunken weakness, Scolari got seduced by her and she claims she was impregnated. Secondly she is living under an assumed name and had a secret from her past. Billy Moses who probably never thought he'd be doing such rough stuff back in law school gets to tangle with a couple of good old boys when goes seeking the truth in Grahn's home town. A little more action than usual for Ken Malansky, he almost gets himself killed.    One big flaw in this mystery is simple forensics. The medical examiner's report should have provided concrete evidence that the victim was killed in such a way that Scolari could not possibly have done the deed. The police should have been looking in a different direction for the killer.    When you see who the killer is you won't blame the individual, but you'll also see how the investigating officer James McEachin got it wrong from the start. It kind of spoils this particular Mason film."
1094,1,"Shaky hand held cameras ( this piece was shot for television mind you, not film) not only keep you utterly conscious of how horrible the cinematography is in this film, but make you absolutely unable to become immersed in the story. Poor Miss Austen must be rolling in her grave. All I can say is, if you enjoyed the novel, stop there, until the BBC creates one of their smart & sensible period masterpieces ( like Pride & Prejudice with Colin Firth, which, speaking for what I imagine in my opinion, Austen would have revered). The BBC would never dare overdub cheesy saxophone solos and Indigo Girl hollers over a shot of an historic castle and a loving embrace. Giles Foster seemed to be often confused that they were editing the music to The Specialist. If you want Austen as you love her, look for the BBC logo ..."
1140,1,This is the best show ever no matter what you say!I have been watching this show since cycle 1.This show is never boring its wonderful how you see peoples dream come true of being a model. Tyra is trying her best to help young women not be ashamed of their bodies and make them believe that they are beautiful in their own way and that you don't have to feel beautiful by being anorexic. And just as Tyra says on the Tyra show so what if your curvy so what if you have a big round booty so what if you have a big nose so what if your not as beautiful as the people in magazines you are beautiful to her. SO WHAT ...............................
1218,1,"I approached this movie with the understanding that it was one of the worst flicks ever made. I sat down to watch it with this mindset, and was pleasantly surprised. It's not great. It's not even that good; in fact, it's pretty poor. However, it's not as bad as I had been led to believe, by a long shot. It's pretty inept, and, evidently as a cost cutting measure, a lot of stock footage is pressed into service, a lot of which has no apparent relation to the narrative. What it is, however, is an intensely personal movie made by a man who evidently did not have the skills or the funding to do his idea justice. Before you discount_ Glen or Glenda?_ out of hand, examine your own artistic skills. Me, I'd love to be able to draw, but anything I try to sketch comes out like stick men. I'd love to be able to sing, but all I do is frighten young children. Wood had an idea, and unfortunately he didn't have what it takes to make it work. However, this was an incredibly daring movie for the puritan 50s, however exploitative or incoherent it may appear at first glance."
1313,1,"It wasn't until I looked at the trivia section that I found out that the original producer/ star of this movie Tyrone Power died during its making. This no doubt explains why everyone on screen seems to have their minds on other things, a symptom of which appears in a very early scene involving a battle that can only be described as pathetic. You know when you've been painting a wall until you're completely bored? Well that's the sort of expression the combatants have on their face when they're swinging their swords in a highly unconvincing manner    The plot centres on Soloman the King of Israel having an affair with the Queen of Sheeba and his people not being happy about it. You can't really blame them since there's few things more beautiful in the world than those Israeli moteks, though the Israeli women here all seem to look like Cherie Blair! Modern day Israel is also very cosmopolitan with the majority of Israelis being born outside the country but would this have been true a couple of thousand years ago where everyone speaks in European and American accents    After much talking and a dance sequence that has to be seen to be believed ( And no that's not praise) we have a climax where the heavily outnumbered Israelis have to defend themselves against a massed Egyptian army who can't read a map otherwise they would have known there was a canyon in front of them. This is what I don't getEven though their blinded by the sun the Egyptians spend ten minutes charging towards the Israelis never ever realising they're charging towards a gaping ravine! Isn't this somewhat illogical? It's also something of a revealing error since the horses, chariots and men falling into the canyon are obviously miniature figures    Anyway the film ends with Soloman killing his treacherous brother and praising God for his victory. But who needs Moshe Dayan, Arik Sharon or God when you've got an idiotic enemy who can't see a ravine in front of him or waves a sword like he paints a wall?"
1394,1,"Hal Hartley entry into a European film series is one of his two or three best efforts to date, and, lucklily, one of the few available on DVD. At only 63 minutes running time, my only quibble would be with Hartley I always leave wanting more, but never so much as this time. Martin Donovan is astonishing as Jesus. PJ Harvey is beautiful and interesting as Magdelena, but the high point for me was Thomas Jay Ryan ( Henry Fool) as Satan. Hartley gives him excellent dialogue and a chance to use his resounding voice to full effect. Look for three scenes in which a microphone awaits him, as if a poetry slam is about to be won by the devil. I have read other comments on this film and had to add mine because there is not enough praise going around. If you like Henry Fool, Martin Donovan in anything ( Opposite of Sex), and/or very clever comedies based on biblical ideas, get this as quickly as possible."
1424,1,"This program would be useful for training hardened felons basic human emotions. Beyond this purpose, the show has no value other than to fill bandwidth that would otherwise go unutilized in the electromagnetic spectrum. I feel a greater sense of suspense and anticipation listening to a computerized voice chip endlessly droning out the products of a random number generator. Fortunately, the helpful and frequent music cues will tell viewers how they're supposed to feel, in case they are unable to fully internalize the predictable and shallow plot line. I did find Amy to be a superficially positive character, as she is a role model to young women that they can serve in traditionally male fields. Unfortunately, her totally subjective approach to the law is guided solely by whatever capricious personal guidelines Amy elects to employ, resulting in Amy's trials more closely resembling appeals to the personal mercy of a tribal despot than a true administration of justice. This show is unpalatable in any amount, although this is to some extent mitigated after two episodes by the brain's godgiven filtering processes, by which the show will thankfully leave the same imprint on the viewer's memory as a television tuned to a dead channel at maximum volume."
1436,1,"The characterization in this movie is among the worst I've ever encountered. The dialogue is trite and clich to the point of extreme distraction. None of the issues the characters face are developed at all -- they're merely surface details intended to get a point across without having to actually come up with believable dialogue to support said point. Also, the depiction of the Chinese characters leaves a bit to be desired -- I find it hard to believe that the Chinese father learns flawless English from a book(or so it is implied in one scene) so he can teach it to his daughter. Etc. The Smile Train is a great organization and it's a nice idea, to make a heartstringtugging film about the impact a program like this can have on kids ' lives, but overall, I found this movie to be more frustrating than anything."
1672,1,"See .. I really wanted to enjoy this movie. There were moments when my heart beat faster, when the hair on my neck began to stand up, when my muscles began to tighten .. but just like a strip tease, I was left with no real action, no resolution, and money missing from my wallet. Jaume Balaguer and Miguel TejadaFlores apparently don't know the correct recipe for making a Horror Movie, and as such, utilized the old amateur cook's method of throwing everything into the pot. This movie is really The Shining, Poltergeist, Amityville, and Hellraiser all rolled into one. Amazing, I know, but true. All the flavors are there, you can taste each of them, they just don't mix well. I'm not gon na go down the list of every thing wrong with this movie; in short, good cinematography, mediocre acting, worse dialogue. The -real- problem with stealing from so many movie plots and combining them into one movie, aside from the resulting confusion, is while you CAN have several plots running at one time, you can't have several endings. And what does Jaume do when he runs into this problem? Just like a Freshman in English 101, you end your story with ellipses, "" The little car vanished into the darkness and ..... THE END "" Oooh, spooky. Not really. And very anticlimactic. The ending left me confused and disappointed; almost empty. Take your$ 10, go rent The Shining, Poltergeist, and Hellraiser .. scare the pants off yourself, have a great time, and forget that The Darkness ever existed.    -BJamin"
1822,1,"This is probably the second best of the Death Wish movies. Death Wish 5 is the best one. Death Wish 3 reminds me of "" West Side Story "" with a new twist. Not even the recent flick "" Gangs of New York "" can measure up with one New York neighborhood in Death Wish 3 which is plagued not by two rival gangs --- but one big gang. A gang that is willing to do things like cutting a person to death with an ax if he trespasses on its set. Deborah Raffin, who plays a public defender, plays gently in this actionpacked movie that is filled with a lot of shootemup violence. So, like Geri Nichols in Death Wish II, Death Wish III scores with its gentle, romantic moments as well as its violent moments. Only the James Bond loveinterest scenes would do much better. And, in addition to his .38, Kersee plays with this new gun called the Wildey .475 Magnum. It reminded me of the Dirty Harry movies when Callahan used his .44 Magnum in Magnum Force, Sudden Impact and Dirty Harry. The Wildey gun packs a big punch and when Kersey kills with it, he doesn't care if the gun has a big kick in it. And that antitank missile that killed off the main gang leader? Well, that is something. Kersey would not use an antitank missile as his regular vigilante weapon .... that is way too military for him."
1885,1,"When I first saw "" Race Against Fear "" ( don't you just love LMN movie titles?), I had to keep scratching my head. Was this meant to be serious? Why couldn't the main character even run like a normal person running, much less like a star runner? How did I know that the coach was evil only 1 minute into the film? All of these questions, and no answers. Then, I just let the inane script and the awful directing just carry me away ... it was easier not to resist ... then the film became funnier by the minute, and I now rank it among my top ten junk movies from LMN. Some have said here that Ariana Richards is really talented but that the material was flawedI heartily disagree. Not only can she not convince me that she's an athlete, she's walks wideeyed through the rest of the story, like she's just landed on earth. Maybe the coach broke out of prison and finished her off ... at least I hope so."
2026,1,"Focus is another great movie starring William H. Macy. I first discovered Macy in Fargo and I've seen a few of his films and he hasn't yet deceived me. Macy is the archetypal "" nice guy with something to hide "". In Focus, he plays the role of Lawrence Newman, a loyal and hardworking stiff, who harbours his handicapped mother at home. The scene is set after World War II, at the height of McCarthyism. Newman is the head of Human Resources for a company which is basically, antiSemite. After he accidentally hires a woman of Jewish descent, he is asked to buy a pair of glasses, to improve his failing eyesight. Unbelievably, the simple act of buying glasses has great repercussions on his life and that of Gertrude Hart, his wife ( played by a great Laura Dern). As the film unravels, Newman will begin to see a whole different world, where being Jewish is akin to being an animal. The movie is disturbing in the way it shows that being racist was something fairly normal. The chilling thought is that in some places, it probably still is."
2159,1,"This short deals with a severely critical writing teacher whose undiplomatic criticism extends into his everyday life. When he learns why that's not a good idea, we learn a bit about the beautiful craft of writing that he's been lecturing on."
2266,1,"There must have been some interesting conversations on the set of Eagle's Wing, with Martin Sheen straight off Apocalypse Now costarred with the actor he replaced on Coppola's film, Harvey Keitel. A real unloved child of a movie, dating back to the last major batch of Westerns in 197980, it was much reviled at the time for being made by a British studio and director ( conveniently ignoring the fact that many of the classic American westerns were directed by European migrs), which seems a bit of an overreaction. The plot is simplicity itself, as Martin Sheen's inexperienced trapper finds himself fighting with Sam Waterston's nonosyllabic Kiowa warrior over the possession of a beautiful white horse, the Eagle's Wing, across a harsh and primitive landscape in a time "" before the legends began. "" Aside from Caroline Langrishe's captive Irish governess, the supporting cast have little to do ( Stephane Audran never even gets to open her mouth) and it is a little slow, but Anthony Harvey's film does boast terrific Scope photography from Billy Williams and a good score from Marc Wilkinson."
2282,1,"YOU BELONG TO ME ( 1941) is a example of the ' ScrewBall Comedy ' which started in the mid 1930s and ended postwar ( WWII). Some of these films maintained their status. Others have earned undeserved praise when originally were critical and box office flops. Like BRINGING UP BABY ( 1938) or MR. & MRS. SMITH ( 1941). Then there is this one which value just keeps sinking. Why can be rooted in the screenplay/ story. It strains credibility from the get go, betraying a superior cast. BARBARA STANWYCK is married to millionaire HENRY FONDA who is insanely jealous. He would be content to sit back with his million$ and love her, she wishes to maintain her profession as a Doctor. She wants him to become in what her eyes is a useful member of society. This conflict is supposed to amuse us. It can not be salvaged by either the principals or the supporting cast. The faults in this scenario can clearly be laid at the feet of DALTON TRUMBO. HENRY FONDAs ' character is written in such broad strokes that any viewer has a instant dislike for him. BARBARA STANWYCK just has nothing to do but react to each idiotic situation of jealousy. TRUMBO must have been spending to much time outside the studio being a "" useful idiot "" then being on the job. COLUMBIA obviously did not get their moneys worth from him, maybe ROBERT RISKIN should taken over."
2292,1,"Aya! If you are looking for special effects that are 1020 years before its time, this is it. The glowing lightning bolts, fireballs, etc. look like they came from a cheesy 70's scifi flick. And yes, Hercules really grows; he's not being pushed on a cart closer to the camera!"
2311,1,"I tivo'd this on Turner Classic just because it was precode and sounded interesting. When I got around to watching, I noticed that the "" critique "" gave it one and a half stars on a fourstar scale. I started watching with trepidation -- even old movies can be bad movies -- but I quickly got engaged in the story and Mary Astor's performance as the business brains behind a simple salesman's rise to success. Not a truly great movie -- too predictable -- but certainly better than advertised. And I would have liked to have seen more of Ricardo Cortez as the man who appreciates Mary but won't give up his wealthy wife. I'd recommend giving it a look just to appreciate Astor and what a long way we've come, baby."
2558,1,"It starts a little slow but give it a chance. In the spirit of the "" Wackiest Ship in the Arm "" and the "" Pink Sub "" this movie is about a not so orthodox group engaged in not so orthodox methods to outwit everyone. Rob Schneider is priceless as a LT that takes himself way too seriously which results in a failed mutiny attempt and "" pirate "" crew makes him walk the plank. In contrast Kelsey Grammar(similar to Cary Grant)does not take anything to serious except the job. This movie is more about lines than plot. From the "" beered up "" fisherman in Charleston harbor to the "" whale "" decoy, their antics took me by surprise and I laughed out loud."
2714,1,"Watching Showtime I got the impression that the producers got the idea to put Robert DeNiro and Eddie Murphy just for the sake of having a film that costarred the two of them. Other than that I can't think of a reason to justify the film's existence. Not that it isn't amusing in spots, it certainly is, but the concept is so completely ludicrous that the laughs are somewhat muted. The thing that really got me was Eddie Murphy's character. I can't seem to wrap my mind around the concept of someone being a police officer as strictly a day job. When I was working person at New York State Crime Victims Board I had to deal with all kinds of cops and they ran the gamut between the really dedicated and some real slugs, but I can't think of one who thought that this was just something I do until I get my career going in an area far afield. I mean, can you really see Eddie Murphy or anyone else going through the rigors of the real Police Academy, not the screen version, just to get a day job? Anyway DeNiro is your basic hard working detective who's on the trail of a major gun dealer. He's undercover and Murphy is part of his backup. So what does the showboating Murphy do, he calls a reality based TV series like COPS to film the action.    So DeNiro's bust gets blown sky high, but the producer of the show gets some good footage of Murphy and DeNiro and decides on a new reality based television series. So these unwilling partners get joined and try to continue working DeNiro's case with all the TV cameras around. Eddie Murphy's a funny guy, I loved him in Beverly Hills Cop and in the Doctor Doolittle movies, but he's done better things than Showtime and Robert DeNiro certainly has.    I guess Murphy wanted a chance to work with DeNiro and DeNiro must have gotten one hefty paycheck to do this film."
2954,1,"It was only a matter of time that a spoof would be made of sports movies! And there are plenty of movies to be spotted which are made fun off. But the biggest problem I had was the fact that it stays with recognizing movies. The director and writers of "" The Comebacks "" somehow forget to get creative. While I must admit that I laughed at certain scenes,""The Comebacks "" could have been so much funnier. The actors forget to deliver their lines seriously and have a straight face throughout the movie. A spoof demands this and that is the main reason why silly jokes work in movies like this. Because of the failure of the cast to do so the jokes never hit their mark. Some scenes take forever and normally in spoofs that doesn't have to be a problem. Take "" Naked Gun "" for instance. Their is always something happening on screen. In "" The Comebacks "" they didn't even bother to let stuff happening in the background. Only a couple of factors make this movie worth watching! It still is fun to spot the movies that are made fun off. And Jermaine Williams as Ipod. His parody on Cuba Gooding Jr. as Radio was hilarious! He seemed to be the only one in the cast to get the idea of what a spoof is about. Not entirely bad!"

3546,1,"I think Homegrown is a bit of a misnomer for this moviemore like "" Plantation Grown "" but it doesn't have quite the same ring to it. My guide described it a comedy, but the pathetic travails of these hapless buffoons is not my idea of a belly laugh. More in the genre of the farcical thriller/ drama. The characters developed well enoughan allstar cast made it ohso promising, just a shame the plot was patently absurd. Ted Danson provided a fine cameo as did Jamie Lee Curtis in her walkon part. Jon Bon Jovi has this amazing ability to measure THC content in the front seat of his car! I guess if you imbibe a few beforehand you should be able to sit through this onenot for the gun shy paranoid types though."
3579,1,"This is a serious film about black revolutionaries and not really an action film. Billy Dee plays a young man fed up with racism who decides to take things into his own hands. It's fairly gritty and realistic without exploiting the characters but still it's not that interesting either and Billy Dee's character, though maltreated by white authority figures, doesn't really come off as sympathetic. It's also hurt by it's extremely low budget. Still, it's interesting to look at as it's a good depicttion of 1970s social issues."
3773,1,"When I think about TV movies, I always think of this film, I have watched it a few times on Sky Movies, it was terrible. Its been a long time, since I have seen this film, was just browsing, and came across it on here: -S. A microbiologist ( Linda Flemming), goes on holiday, with her son ( William Flemming), at this holiday resort kinda place, they meet up with Paul Johnson ( taxi driver/ owns a bar?), and Kathy Johnson. Its like a weird romantic thing, William starts to fall for Kathy, and Paul falls for Linda. Some guy passes out in a street, he has some mark on his arm, Joseph ( Joseph was a deep sea diver, who on some dive, saw a light, or something, and converted to religion), says he will take care of this person, there is a gap in my memory, then there is a wide out break of the virus, I think Linda offers her help, to come up with a cure, Kathy gets infected ( William notices a mark on Kathy's arm), with the virus, also does Joseph. Paul says some lines to Joseph, then Joseph stumbles away, the next time you see Joseph, he is cured some how, that information is used to cure the infected, then there is a beach party, the end."
4017,1,"Some will say this movie is a guilty pleasure. I loved this flick but I don't feel guilty about it. You can tell the whole cast and crew had fun making this movie. But Jack Frost 2 won't go over well with some people. Right from the beginning you can tell this movie will be cheesy and it definitely has an amateurish look to it. Well, if you get the privilege to watch this movie, after watching it remember that Jack Frost 2: Revenge of the Mutant Killer Snowman is a pleasure, not a guilty pleasure. Now, because I can't fill up ten lines heres some great scenes:  ** SPOILERS**    The three women on the beach had great deaths. The first one had Jack in a tree trying to drop icicles on one of them. He kept missing so he dropped an anvil on her. The next woman fell on a bed of icicles. The last one was stabbed in the eyes with tongs. The other great one was where two surfers stoners are hanging out near a frozen pole. One of them gets their tongue stuck on it ( of course). Jack Frost pulls him back a rips his tongue off while saying "" COWATONGUEA DUDE! "". Well, you have to see it for yourself. And of course, the snowball children kicked ass.** END SPOILERS** infinity stars"
4645,1,"So I turned on the TV today at 1:00 PM on a Sunday, expecting to see crap and infomercials, and this great movie was just starting, didn't know what it was but drew me in almost immediately. The movie was excellent. there were a couple of things that didn't make sense for one I don't get why the dead guy was talking about doing stuff to get yourself out of your bad situation, but then Jimmy doesn't really do anything except the basic stuff to survive that anyone would do in his situation, in other words it wasn't his initiative that got him out of his bad situation it was just luck, second I don't get the thing about the girl killing the the gangsters at the end, because the whole thing was partly casued by the thief people stealing Panda's money, and then the other thief kills Panda at the end, so they steal his money twice, and kill him how is that good?"
4858,1,"The movie was very good. I'm an avid mystery fan and I usually figure out who is going to be killed and who did the killing. While I did figure out who was going to be killed I didn't figure out who did it. I wasn't happy with the portrayal of the Gerda character but given the year the movie was supposed to take place it is possible the woman would have been that ' cloying '. Please know that while these Poirot movies are good, they just don't have the same dynamic to them as the series does because they don't have Japp, Ms. Lemon and especially Hastings! David Suchet is definitely Poirot. I have seen every actor who's played him. The worst was Peter Ustinov!"
6244,1,"There are several ways to misunderstand this movie and a couple of them have been shown in some of the past comments. This is a movie to be analyzed as a free recreation of a known subject and therefore not to be compared with the opera, the book or other Carmen movies seen before. It just stands for itself and I must say that this Carmen does it very well. It is a mistake to compare because that is the first step to deny movies the chance to be autonomous creative works of art. Vicente Aranda is a master of atmosphere and the art direction, the costumes and the photography are extremely well put together to achieve a pleasing aesthetic experience. Let's take it as it is. And that brings us to the next misunderstanding. Someone complains about the typical Spanish clichs in the movie. Well, historically the movie is extremely well researched and you can see the results of that very serious work in every scene. It is not only an accurate portrait of the "" black Spain "" of knife and espadrille that Goya portrayed so vividly, but it's also of that part of history as seen by a foreigner fascinated with the folkloric side of that society. Honestly, anyone who doesn't want to see any clich about Spain shouldn't buy a ticket to see Carmen, but in this case those clichs are presented before they became one and the way to see them is getting rid of our own prejudices. Another important requirement to understand this movie properly is to speak the language. It is not acceptable to criticize any actor performance for not having understood his or her lines. If all the rest of the audience did, the problem most likely lies somewhere else. Paz Vega has an immaculate diction with her Andalusian accent and all she says is understandable and credible. Her Argentinian partner, Leonardo Sbaraglia, gives also a convincing portrait of the Basque officer that became a "" bandolero "", and her accent is very well learned. No less important is to have a minimally open approach to the material. To say that Paz Vega is "" horrible "" suggests that the author of the phrase entered the theater for the wrong reasons. We already had in Spain a critic in one of the most prestigious papers that used to recommend us pictures he found homosexually arousing, without mentioning it explicitly. And that was not totally fair for the rest of us, especially for the ones that hadn't detected that the man was writing with parts of his anatomy that many readers didn't necessarily had to care for. I'm not suggesting at all that the reviewer had the same motivation, but the expectations must have been different as the ones of those among us that went to see a talented and beautiful actress play an almost classic role, because that's what we got. Paz Vega IS Carmen, and an excellent one, in Vicente Aranda's movie."
6779,1,"Back in the 60's, this grim study of Joy, a young proletarian wife, was the introduction to the career of Ken Loach, who became one of the most distinguished and respected British filmmakers of all time. By then I knew very little about Brecht, politics or the reality of the underprivileged, and I was quite impressed by the aesthetic of the film, its free style, its austere color cinematography, and Joy's monologues in front of the camera. I was also much surprised to find that Terence Stamp ( who had become a celebrity, thanks to "" Billy Budd "", "" The Collector "" and "" Modesty Blaise "") had so little screen time. Although 20th Century Fox distributed "" Poor Cow "" in Panama, Loach did not stay in mainstream cinema ( which this film hardly is) and I lost contact with his films. I just heard of his successes, "" Kes "", "" Family Life "", "" Black Jack "". until I caught up in the 80's. The beautiful title song by Donovan, by the way, is available in his anthology "" Troubadour ""."
18198,0,"On a Clear Day You Can See Forever is nothing more than a New Age update of the "" Pygmalion ""/ "" My Fair Lady "" story: A professor attempts to turn a common girl into an upper society woman. This time, however, instead of using language skills, the professor tries to do so by hypnotism and past life regression. You know a musical has problems when reviewers constantly mention the sets and the costumes before they mention the plot and the music. The songs are instantly forgettable. ( No "" Get Me to the Church on Time "" here, I'm afraid.) And the plot goes nowhere. To paraphrase Gertrude Stein, there is no "" there "" here. The characters wander through the story without ever getting from point A to point B. Professor Chabot claims several times that he will get to the root of Daisy's troubles, but he never seems to do so. All meaningful conflict is avoided. For instance, there comes a time when Chabot's university demands he either stop his research into reincarnation or resign his position. Now there is conflict! Will he give up his career for Daisy? Alas! Nothing comes of this development. A scene or two later the university changes its mind and tells Chabot to continue on with his work. So much for conflict. The talent was certainly assembled for this movie: Directed by Vincente Minnelli. Written, in part, by Alan Jay Lerner. A cast of Yves Montand, Bob Newhart and Jack Nicholson. And, oh yes, starring Barabara Striesand who was nearly at the top of her game at this point in her career. But it all falls flat. Lerner's attempt to reincarnate his greatest success, the previously mentioned "" My Fair Lady, "" is as doomed to failure as Daisy's attempt to revive the greatness of her own past. If you enjoy movie musicals, there are far better choices than this."
18199,0,"Luc Besson's first work is also his first foray in science fiction, a genre to which he will return fourteen years later with "" the Fifth Element "" ( 1997). Even if this film was strongly influenced by Hollywood cinema, it is still highly enjoyable. Back in 1983, "" le Dernier Combat "" reveals Besson's own approach of science fiction. He takes back a threadbare topic and his efforts are discernible to make a stylish work. Shot in widescreen and black and white, a disaster has destroyed virtually all the population from earth and we will never know what was this disaster and why men can't talk any more. Some barbarian hordes were formed. In parallel, a man ( Pierre Jolivet) lives on his own and arrives in an unrecognizable Paris where he is received by a doctor ( Jean Bouise). There are no words in Besson's work. The characters ' actions and the progression of the events go through looks and gestures. Although the starting point and the backdrop are unnerving, the film has never the look of a despondent one. It seems that the man and the doctor try to reproduce gestures and actions linked to mankind before the disaster. The film opens with the man having sex with an inflatable doll. Later, the doctor tries to make him speak through a machine and he is a painter in his spare time. It's all the more intriguing as these paintings seem to come from the prehistoric times. Following this reasoning, one could argue that the bearded giant ( Jean Reno) embodies evil and a threat to the efforts deployed by the man and the doctor to regain what finally made a human being. Ditto for the gang of baddies at the beginning of the film. The pessimistic whiff that such a film could convey isn't really at the fore and gives way to a glimmer of hope. Personally, the film could have gained with no music at all, except the one the man can hear with his cassette recorder. Luc Besson was to make better and still entrancing films like this one, he also boosted Pierre Jolivet's career as a director who will leave a patchy work behind him in the future: "" Force Majeure "" ( 1989), "" Simple Mortel "" ( 1991), "" ma Petite Entreprise "" ( 1999) or "" Filles Uniques "" ( 2003)."
18200,0,"First off, to rent or watch this film you are expecting something in the Bhorror range. What this film delivers for the astute fan of this genre is quite a hilarious romp via nordic flavor. At times reminding me of the humor of Jackson's Dead Alive and others of a Stuart Gordon flick this little find should have most chuckling throughout.    The f/ x reach a few highs of truly spooky ( the first time Ed meets his nemesis) but generally have the feel that this film was put together by a f/ x team that decided to use any and all props at their disposal from other films ... gremlins, devils, slasher films, etc. to pretty good effect and worked in thru the use of hallucinations.    The gem of the film is the humor. The gore works most of the time but more for laughs. At its heart its a parody and a fun one at that."
18201,0,"Following the advice of a friend, I got myself this movie. I'm very fond of computers in generalhence why a 1995 film about identity theft on the Internet could not be left unseen. I had some bad echoes about it, but in the end, I wasn't so disappointed: the story, though classical, is kind of interesting and must have been really new back in the days when it was released in theatres. I was gladly surprised when I figured out that contrary to what we usually see, computerperformed actions are somehow realistic, as they use Windows 3.x and normal computers. The storytelling is median and not bothering the viewer. The end is typically American. The actors ' performance is globally OK, Sandra Bullock usually annoys me with her "" oh my god why me "" way to behave, but this time she seems to have controlled herself. I'd recommend that movie."
18202,0,"I originally watched this because I thought it was going to be the sequel to the League of EXTRAORDINARY Gentlemen and this movie is a whole different thing entirely going on herea comedy! However, I loved it anyways!    The League of Gentlemen is apparently some British TV series with some rather odd characters and some sharp humour. This is British comedy so it revolves around being very silly, dressing up in costumes and making lots of fun of Germans and french, homosexual references- in short it's very very funny! THe plot revolves around the writers of the TV show deciding to cancel some of the characters and the characters coming out of their dimension into the writer's dimension to stop that from happening. It's a fun twist and there's plenty of great scenes in this idiotic adventure. I laughed out loud numerous times and applauded the brazen style of humour. This makes Mr Bean look like the watered down wimp he is.(Rowan is much better in Black Adder series btw) This is not Monty Python, but you can never escape the comparison when you are talking British humour, and there are a few similarities but not so many as to keep it from being it's own thing and being fresh. It leans more towards the young ones and Guest House Paradiso in its ' comedic style. If you liked this, check out The Young Ones series and Guest House Paradiso movie, and of course, I assume the TV series League of Gentlemen must be rather funny as well."
18203,0,"There is no "" fun "" poking fun at the desperate plight of illegal immigrants! Or the desperate plight of headshop owners, for that matter! That the richerthanGod Brian Glazer didn't see the irony of having the "" heroes "" do exactly what the villain doesrob honest, hardworking people of their life savingsdoesn't surprise me! Hell, how do you think he got to be richer than God?! In this alleged satire about greed, these mental midgets reveal their own hypocrisy: the McMansions, the McToys, the McChildren, the McIllegals who are paid peanuts to take care of the McMansions, the McToys, and the McChildren! But the main problem ( aside from the revolting bigotry) is the premise: as the former executive of a nowinfamous company, Dick would be the Big Scalp for every corporate headhunter in the country! No soup kitchens for him! And, raking in high sixfigures, you'd think he wouldn't be caught dead around a Gore/ Lieberman poster!"
18204,0,"After seeing the film version of Heart Of Darkness, I feel as if I wasted 100 minutes of my life. Though the book was not my favorite, I was very disappointed to see how poorly Nicolas Roeg portrayed the story. Despite the fact that he left out many bits of important information, the cast just did not seem to fit their roles and the whole film seemed vastly emotionless. The book depicts vivid scenery and detail that are completely disregarded in the movie.    You'd think a director would be able to fit 76 pages of a book into a film of at least an hour and a half. The differences completely changed the story for me. For example, when the character of Kurtz's fiance is nonchalant to the fact that Kurtz has died, it completely modifies the ending the book had given. Not to mention the sets and scenery used in the film were not nearly as beautiful as they were described. It sincerely feels as if Roeg was filming another story with references from Heart Of Darkness embedded in it.    If you watch the movie without knowing the title or expecting it to be anything like Joseph Conrad's tale, you may find it good. Though I thought the camera work was poor and the cast unfitting, it is a captivating story all the same. However, if you are looking for a good movie version of the famous classic story, don't look for it in Roeg's film."
18205,0,"Perhaps this movie is a little too long, but it still has some charm 45 years later. The main roles seem more appropriate for Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh. I could care less about Gary Cooper, but Ingrid Bergman is fine, particularly in dark hair. The movie is worth seeing for the supporting cast: Flora Robson is terrific as a mulatto servant. She is a white woman in blackface, and can have an expression of evil or of a voodoo mistress. Jerry Austin as a servant dwarf has a delightful role, that keeps you chuckling despite some overlong scenes. Speaking of scenes, Florence Bates steals most of the ones she is in as a dowager social lady. I didn't understand the outcome of the railroad fight at the end of the movie, and the last scene was pure Hollywood dreck. It's an odd feeling when you realize the film title refers to a railroad rather than a piece of luggage!"
18206,0,"I am surprised that so many comments about this film are positive. Having read the book several times ( and all the other historical novels by Mika Waltari) there is no way to say much good in this film. If I forget the origins of the story I might consider it a reasonably good epic. Of course to bring such a brick of a book to the big screen is a task not to be envied, but it could be done with class. I can't understand why even the name of Nefernefernefer had to be shortened to just Nefer. I love Peter Ustinov as Kaptah and Marlon Brando probably would have made a better Sinuhe but the overall attitude is too Hollywood to ever make justice to the book. Mind you Mika Waltari left the Premier of this film in the middle of the showing. That's how much he liked it."
18207,0,"The original Airport ( 1970) was a classic of its kind, and the first two Bmovie followups ( Airport 1975; Airport ' 77) were watchable fun at best, amusing camp at worst; but this crass and inept final entry lacks any entertainment value and displays a shocking contempt for its audience. It's unendurable and not even good for laughs.    All of the three "" Airport "" sequels were theatrical releases made by Universal's television wing but this one is beneath even the modest standards of a TV movie of its day, with cheapjack production, grotesque casting, visual ugliness and tasteless, unfunny "" comedy "". The project was clearly doomed by the "" creative "" efforts of Universal executive Jennings Lang who personally produced and is given a "" story "" credit. Everyone starts somewhere, and writer Eric Roth ( Forrest Gump) might have provided an element of selfburlesque, as had the previous films ( especially the notorious Airport 1975), but there is nothing worth spoofing in Roth's turgid, incoherent script and even the comedy Airplane! left this crud untouched. What makes The Concorde: Airport ' 79 particularly offensive is its insulting misuse of professionals. The worst victim is the supremely gifted Cicily Tyson ( Sounder; The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman), pitilessly reduced to a vomitous subplot involving her escorting a frozen heart transplant on the unfortunate flight.    A special kick to the groin is reserved for the wonderful George Kennedy, who is the true lead despite being buried in the cast list. The official mascot of the "" Airport "" series and the only actor to appear in all four movies, Kennedy had more than earned the starring role and his turn in the Captain's seat would have been the only possible reason for this entry other than the squeezing of one last buck. Kennedy provides the only warmth and real humor in this mechanical muckup, briefly putting aside the bravura machismo and revealing a genuinely sweet and tender side to himself, and his lovable and heroic character of "" Joe Patroni "". Unfortunately we are never allowed to forget how fat and old and overthehill Kennedy is, and overage prettyboy Alain Delon relentlessly calls him "" Porky Pig "" as part of a buddybonding that falls completely flat. Even Kennedy's Parisian romance, the only humane part of this planewreck, turns out to be merely a setup for a hateful joke at Patroni's, Kennedy's, and the viewer's expense."
18210,0,"I remember watching Police Squad! when it first came on ABC in 1982 and I thought it was a very funny show, thanks to the many sight gags, non sequitors and scripts filled with word play. In one episode, there was a line where a man named Once was shot twice.    But unfortunately, ABC canceled the show after only six episodes. I felt it deserved a much longer run but a network executive thought the show demanded too much attention of the viewer because of all the sight gags in each episode. One that I remember was in the opening where the episode's title was different from the one shown on the screen.    Leslie Nielsen's portrayal of Frank Drebin was deadpan, yet very funny and his role was in the narrative style of Jack Webb of Dragnet. Alan North did well and Peter Lupus, in one of his few roles since Mission: Impossible wasn't bad as Norberg, But the one character that stood out was Johnny the Shoeshine Boy, played by William Duell. After giving advice to Drebin, there were cameos from Dick Clark, Dr. Joyce Brothers and then Dodger manager Tommy LaSorda.    Even though Police Squad! had a short life on ABC, the Zucker Brothers didn't give up on the concept which turned out even more successful in the Naked Gun movie franchise. I'll close with a regular closing gag. Freeze the ending right here."
18212,0,One of Bolls better attempts. Just shows that if you do something long enough you have to improve just by chance. It is still not good but it is at least watchable which is an improvement over the bloodrayne. The main difference between Bloodrayne and FarCry really is that the story from Farcry wasn't the games strong point whereas Bloodrayne had a strong story and thus Boll had more chance to mess it up. The action in this movie is actually fairly good. Occasionally a touch overdone but in a good way and worth a watch just for that. Acting wise it was pretty decent. Most of the actors are pretty good but you can tell they aren't taking it seriously based on comparisons with other performances. But the lighter mood this gives to the film actually helps. While I think sticking a little bit closer to the story of the game might have made for a slightly better film the changes made are pretty practical and not big enough to make a difference. Especially given the plot of the game was hardly Oscar winning just a vehicle for FPS carnage. Would have liked it set in the Jungle as that was a pretty integral part of the game but Canada doesn't have a great deal of Jungle and it is at least set in a kind of rainforest. Why Boll feels the need to change already professionally scripted and directed game plots I don't know but he does. And until he starts letting the source material speak through his adaptations will always be lacking. Watch the film for a laugh its good for that and maybe for watching during a party as drinking party fodder.
18214,0,"In the spirit of the Great Space Coaster, but a few years earlier. Hot Fudge was one of the psychedelic kid's shows that I grew up on. Seymour was a big, fuzzy, green puppet, with a crescent smile of enormous teeth which nearly split his head, I recall him wearing a variety of Elton Johntype shades. He "" played "" piano, and had a Jesus looking dude in a white tux, sitting next to him. They would have a moral discussion and then do a song about it. Don't remember much else except the opening theme, Seymour and the Hippie. No one else I know remembers it at all. I grew up in Jersey, so if it was produced in Detroit as a previous post said, it wasn't just local. Seymour reminded me a lot of Sherlock the Squirrel from the Magic Garden ( another psychedelic kids show if there ever was one.) People always talk about LSD's effects of music and movies of the 70s, but it seems kid's show writers got a dose as well."
18215,0,"This movie was strange mainly because the plot was so incoherent. The title refers to a vicious wind which renders the surface of the earth almost uninhabitable when it blows, but this seemed to have nothing whatsoever to do with what was going on. The movie seems to be an extremely poor ripoff of Bladerunner ie rogue android being chased by bounty hunter(or ruthless cop in this). Luke Skywalker turns in a surprisingly good performance as aforementioned rogue cop. Nothing seems to be resolved at the end of the movie, we never find out anything of any substance about the android or what his intentions are. There is one baffling scene where Bill Paxton(who has kidnapped the android) plays one particular song in his cardboard airplane for no particular reason(the song is called "" Shape of things "", by The Yardbirds). This happens again in a later scene where the same song is played for no apparent reason. Does this song have any relevance to the movie? Don't think so."
18216,0,"I did not think Haggard was the funniest movie of all time I like CKY and Viva La Bam a lot more. I think a lot of it was just really stupid and had no plot for being a movie. I highly recommend not paying a lot of money for this movie but anyone who likes viva la bam, CKY, or Jack Ass should see it. I loved many parts of the movie and then there were parts that should have been cut out. I think that Jonny Knoxville should have played in the movie because he is a much better actor then most of the people from Haggard and probably could have made this movie allot more funnier. I think Ryan Dunn was probably the best actor and it should have had bam skating more."

18224,0,"This movie had the potential to be a very good movie in my eyes, Nicholas Sparks is a great romance author and this movie had every chance to be just as great as The Notebook but what s sets the two apart is the notebook had a dream team of leads in McAdams and Gosling but here the balance is thrown miserably off by the inept acting of Channing Tatum I felt a lot of the scenes were uneven purely because of his performance, a lot of the emotion in various scenes is lost because he ca nt act, leaving an awkward and uneven situation, Amanda Seyfried given a great performance only to have Tatum drop the ball and the mood is lost and the scene ca nt recover. This story deserved to be cast right, but what it got was a pretty boy who ca nt act. Tatum should stick to what he s good at, movies that are more about his physical ability, albeit horrible, like GI JOE, step up, and Fighting. The less he talks the better. Try not to think of me as a jaded hater of Channing Tatum I went in to this movie with an open mind, because I've been surprised many a time by the likes of Adam Sandler in Reign over Me. I gave the same chance to Tatum I didn't view him here as the sum of his past roles, purely just by his performance in this movie, which sadly was a letdown"
18225,0,"Maybe, like most others who have seen this film long after it's premiere on television, I wanted to see many of my favorite actors in old and obscure form, which is exactly what ' Slow Burn ' is. Except, aside from the nostalgic value, the movie itself is not very good. Eric Roberts plays former reporter Jacob Ash, hired by a Gerald McMurty ( Raymond J. Barry), a rich artist, to investigate the whereabouts of his estranged son, Brian, who had been living with his mother, Laine ( Beverly D'Angelo) for the past few years. In a Phillip Marloweesquire fashion Jacob Ash narrates what would become more than just an investigation into the whereabouts of Brian. But, once Jacob tracks down Laine, his discoveries break open wide a whole lot of trouble. Perhaps because events in the film move too slowly, there is never much suspense to this little thriller, not even by the end with the finale routine of revealing the culprits and their motives. However, as said before, this movie is probably one that will draw attention for it's thenrelatively unknown cast of actors, which include both a very young Eric Roberts as well as the adorable Johnny Depp, who plays Laine's stepson, Donnie. That may be reason enough to give it a try ... if you can find it."
18228,0,"Hey all, I just wanted to give you all a few crazy facts about this movie. I was actually one of the Makeup FX artists that help create the "" beast "" for this movie and I have to tell you the original creature looked absolutely amazing. I remember when we got the first photos back from the set we were all talking about how much of a shame it was that this creature was in a movie that would probably be pretty poor. What actually happened though was that Jason Palmer did the original makeup for the Sasquatch, but for some reason they had to go back and reshoot much of the creature. The sad part was that Jason passed away a few weeks before that and so the redone creature was no where near as awesome as the original one. For me it was quite sad because this was Jasons final movie, and he sort of got cheated out of his final fame due to the bad reshoots. Anyway, I thought you guys may find that a tad interesing, and if you would like you can head over to mmmyeah.com and check out some "" behind the scenes "" photos. Later, Jeff"
18229,0,"I've already seen spinoffs of cartoons such as The Flintstones, Scooby Doo, Tom and Jerry and Looney Tunes and most of them are great. When I saw the All Grown Up pilot in 2001, I thought it was interesting to see how the Rugrats would look in their preteens/ teens and it contained things that would usually happen during that time of life such as going to a concert, going to school and being grounded. The actual TV show is better because the Rugrats seem to wear different clothes in each episode and Angelica doesn't get punished as much as she did in the original Rugrats series. Tommy and Susie get punished in this series. I've also noticed references to Rugrats in this show and even flashbacks of how the Rugrats looked in the original series. They actually talk to the adults in this show because they're 10 years older. This show is aimed at a slightly older audience than the original Rugrats. Viewers of the original show may like this."
18230,0,"Have you ever tried a kind of food that your friend made, and then said to yourself, "" wow, that was not a good mix ""? Well, that is how I felt after watching this film. Many viewers will be left highly uncomfortable with this weird mix of crime and very, very corny comedy. Its almost like watching Mr. Rogers play a ruthless gangster, very weird. Some things just don't mix and this film clearly proves that. There are some very good performances here, as Dean Stockwell, Mercedes Ruhle, and Alec Baldwin are all excellent, but that doesn't make up for the lack of balance and symmetry in the film. Jonathan Demme has done some excellent work in films such as Silence of the Lambs and Philadelphia, but seems to be out of his element with this one."
18231,0,"It was only a matter of time that a spoof would be made of sports movies! And there are plenty of movies to be spotted which are made fun off. But the biggest problem I had was the fact that it stays with recognizing movies. The director and writers of "" The Comebacks "" somehow forget to get creative. While I must admit that I laughed at certain scenes,""The Comebacks "" could have been so much funnier. The actors forget to deliver their lines seriously and have a straight face throughout the movie. A spoof demands this and that is the main reason why silly jokes work in movies like this. Because of the failure of the cast to do so the jokes never hit their mark. Some scenes take forever and normally in spoofs that doesn't have to be a problem. Take "" Naked Gun "" for instance. Their is always something happening on screen. In "" The Comebacks "" they didn't even bother to let stuff happening in the background. Only a couple of factors make this movie worth watching! It still is fun to spot the movies that are made fun off. And Jermaine Williams as Ipod. His parody on Cuba Gooding Jr. as Radio was hilarious! He seemed to be the only one in the cast to get the idea of what a spoof is about. Not entirely bad!"
18232,0,"Earth has been destroyed in a nuclear holocaust. Well, parts of the Earth, because somewhere in Italy, a band of purebred survivors -- those without radioactive contamination -- are holed up in a massive mansion surrounded by lush grounds, waiting for the next opportunity to go hunting for those with polluted blood. The Final Executioner is the story of one of their would be victims, Alan ( William Mang, who looks, not surprisingly, a lot like Kurt Russell), and his efforts to take down the legally sanctioned hunters, who are led by Edra ( Marina Costa) and Erasmus ( Harrison Muller Jr.). Alan has been trained to kill by former NYPD cop Sam ( Woody Strode) who mostly hangs around giving his pupil moral support and mooching for tinned meat. Strode is by far the best thing about the film, though he doesn't look at all well and only appears for about a third of the running time. As for the story, it's a blending of elements from better films and stories, including Ten Little Indians, The Most Dangerous Game, and Escape From New York. The Final Executioner moves along at a fair pace and provides reasonable entertainment for less discriminate action fans."
18236,0,"This, ladies and gentlemen, is truly a modern Bmovie. The dialog is stilted and delivered with wooden rigidity, the premise is predictable ( there are a few decent twists) and characters remain 2D for most of it. And yet there is a certain ... charm. WWE wrestler Kane brings to life the sick, twisted monster of a man with a lot of pathos ( though it is somewhat like his character that he's been playing around ten years) and so I'll find it quite amusing when people say it's "" not much of a reach for him, "" but Glen Jacobs is, apparently, quite the nice guy, so actually it is. In any event, he's cast perfectly as the hulking brute and the deaths are suitably over the top ( Jason would be proud), but I heard at least four applause breaks for four different kills scenes. Frankly go into this movie thinking that you'll have some fun and a gorefest, oh it is QUITE the gorefest. The Rrating IS richly deserved and I actually got a little nauseous during some of the more graphic times. In any event, a very, very fun, but fairly bad, movie."
18237,0,"Well, how to start? I saw The Italian Job for the first time some years ago and visiting a rental shop I couldn't quite remember why I had a bad feeling about it. Now I do. After voting for the ratings for this film I saw the statistics. Apparently this film appeals most to under 18 girls. No wonder. They didn't pay enough to Charlize to flash and I guess some girls magazine has rated Mark Wahlbergs abs "" AWESOME "". Other than that this film is completely predictable, the actors are mainly forever Bstars and even the good ones are being misused horribly, the film is filled with obvious product placement and imagine this: it even manages to repeat itself without doing a sequel! The first 15 minutes are the best part of the film and it's all downhill from there and once they figured this out they decided to use the finest hour again in the end repeatingtodetail their gold heist. All in all, lots of noise about nothing. I think Charlize Theron is good and Ed Norton could be more as he's been before. Apart from Donald Sutherland's "" look, I'm here too "" appearing in the beginning I'd say this movie ought to have a "" pass if you're above 18 "" all over it."
18240,0,"To be brief, the story is paper thin and you can see the ending coming from a mile away, but Gene Kelly, Rita Hayworth, and an impossibly young Phil Silvers keep the movie afloat throughout and at times lift it right up into the air. A few of the songs are terrible clunkers ( "" Poor John "" is a train wreck) but most of them are great fun, and the scene of Hayworth performing on the absurdly huge set for Kelly's rival has to be seen to be believed. Another treat is the perfect fauxNYC sets in the best Hollywood tradition. Another attraction, if you consider such things attractions, is the howlingly awful male "" chivalry "" toward women. The oily leering and transparent obsequiousness that passed for male charm back then ( in the movies, at least) is presented in its most lurid form here. Some of the men are about like a cartoon wolf. One minor disappointment is Eve Arden trapped in a role so minor that she barely has a chance to do anything. I can imagine a lot of potential comic interplay between her and Silvers -- a missed opportunity."
18243,0,"i consider this movie as one of the most interesting and funny movies of all time. It has so much highly intelligent thoughts in it, that anybody who thinks the movie is awful did not get it and is not able to recognize really deep philosophical themes, which are in it ( in all the 3 Schneider movies) without a doubt. Several universities in germany and throughout europe have made studies on Schneider's way of seeing things. By the way, Helge Schneider is a very intelligent and sensitive person and on of the Jazzmusicions in germany ( maybe europe). He is mostly inspired by the great M.Davis and T.Monk. So if you do not like him, it is ok, but please do not try to convince others that he might be stupid, cheap, boring or not funny. Because if you had to face this opinion in a discussion and if you are willing to really look into the art of H.Schneider you would have to "" surrender ""."

18250,0,"I pretty much liked every character on this show from the start except Reba herself. She comes off as an holier than thou type and quite frankly a big Bully. And that stinks because she is in every scene and every episode. In the later seasons Van becomes unlikeable too, like a spoof of his former self. and Kyra walks around sneering and being miserable. The first 3 to 4 seasons are pretty good if you overlook Reba. Towards the end its pretty bleak .. In basically every episode Barbara jean Is walking around being dumb, Reba is being mean to her, but poor Ole Barbara jean desperately wants Reba to like her which results in Barabara jean telling Reba how awesome she is in every episode. I think it is pretty clear to see Reba has self esteem issues and wants to be seen as this all forgiving saint. Its really a shame too because other than her the show had such potential."
18251,0,"17/02/09 "" More "" ( 1969) Dir: Barbet Schroeder    For a film that most viewers have agreed is pretty average, I'm impressed by quite how many differing interpretations have been offered of it. I've only scoured the web quite briefly and I've already been informed that "" More "" is: a 19th Centurystyle romance, an allusion to the story of Icarus, a plain film full of dull people, and of interest only to Pink Floyd completists. It's fair to say, then, that critical reception is mixed. I would argue that these wildly disparate readings of Barbet Schroeder's 1969 directorial debut are proof enough that "" More "" is anything but a pretty average film. Neither is it a masterpiece, of course. I approached "" More "" as I did "" Easy Rider "" and Antonioni's "" Blowup "" as a ' timecapsule ' film, a snapshot of an eradespite the differences in pace, style and content between these movies. They all have similar flawseither vague or downright unlikeable characters, acting that seems slightly adrift from reality, relaxed editing, and abrupt endings that have left viewers indignant. These movies never try to be persuasive or meet the audience half waythey are what they are, man. This in itself is not a problem as long as we are left with a souvenir of the experience. Thankfully, "" More "" offers several truly memorable images, sounds and suggestions to the viewer, and this is what saves it. Stefan is a young man who arrives in Paris fresh from his studies in Germany. The first part of the film follows him as he falls in with a group of French hipsters, accompanies them to devastatingly cool and selfconscious parties and bars before meeting Estelle. The two characters become sexually and romantically involved and he promises to follow her to Ibiza, against the advice of his friend Charlie. This is where the Icarus thing comes into playshe is the Sun, he is pursuing her. You may now be able to guess how this all ends. Ibiza is an idyll so far away from the bustling urgency of the overpopulated Paris that the naive Stefan knows he must be on to a good thing. Estelle remains elusive and erratic, and the island has a less desirable underbelly. Up until now I had cared little for either of these characters and their unfocused pursuit of somewhere to be really free, but once the action is pared down to just these two the film becomes poignant quite suddenly. During just one single wistful exchange of dialogue in the remote villa they inhabit, the place where their volatile love crystallises, I went from watching with a fading optimism to being utterly enraptured. I can't think of many other films that have done this. The relationship between Stefan and Estelle is real and human in that we can see it go from lifedefining intimacy to disillusionment and cruel coldness. They take a lot of drugs and cavort naked on the terraces, the rocks and beaches. Their lives revolve around nothing but each other and the beautiful Mediterranean surroundings. For a while, their situation is the very essence of freedom, emotional openness and experience for its own sake. But Stefan is not in control, and this is the downfall of more than just his future on Ibiza. Pink Floyd's score is a perfect fit for the exoticism, the intimacy, and the foreboding of "" More "". It is one of the most memorable inclusions, along with the mosquito netting around Estelle's bed, and their hallucinogenic exuberance around the windmill ( which appears on the soundtrack album's front cover). A scene in which they take acid to escape from heroin withdrawal is illustrative of the fundamental flaws of the couplethey can not ' land ' without a crash. Maybe they've come too close to what they wanted. Stefan never makes contact with any family or friends from before his arrival in Paris. We are left to presume they have no idea where he is. While other 1960s Counterculture movies dwell on debauchery, excess, the media and voyeurism, Schroeder has instead presented us with a story focused upon one man, who backs himself into a little corner somewhere in the world and quietly disappears."
18252,0,"I've read all the Dave Robicheaux novels and consider James Lee Burke to be my favorite contemporary fiction writer. I've also visited New Iberia and much of Acadiana to be able to better visualize the setting in most of these books. Needless to say, I greatly anticipated seeing "" In the Electric Mist, "" especially since I thought Tommy Lee Jones would be terrific as Robicheaux. I was greatly disappointed. The story was very choppy; the interplay with the "" ghosts of Confederate dead "" was shallow and lost the impact and nobility it added to the book; and Tommy Lee Jones was doleful, expressionless and difficult to understand as DR. The best way to describe this forgettable film is to add my "" ditto "" to an earlier user comment that this movie was like one of those old madeforTV movies. I expected Jill St. John or Cameron Mitchell to show up at any time. The location settings were accurate, and the photography at times captured the essence of the steamy bayous, smoky juke joints and eerie aboveground graveyards of South Louisiana. Too bad the story's disjointed presentation and Tommy Lee's subpar performance interfered with the unique mood and spicy zest of the region. Next to final comment: In the novels, Dave Robicheaux's nickname is "" Streak, "" because of the distinct streak of silvergray hair on one side of his head. ( Similar to how the Sopranos ' Paulie Walnuts would appear if he were seen only in profile.) Tommy Lee had no such streak in this film, probably because the editors are James Lee Burke fans and they airbrushed the streak out after witnessing Mr. Jones's poor imitation of Dave Robicheaux. Final comment: While I generally find Alec Baldwin to be pompous and obnoxious in most roles, he was by far a better Robicheaux in "" Heaven's Prisoners "" than Tommy Lee was in "" In the Electric Mist. "" Also, Heaven's Prisoners is much more interesting and exciting, with uniformly believable performances and more evocative atmosphere than this new movie. "" In the Electric Mist "" is okay to watch when one feels like "" veging out "" and there's nothing better on TV. But then, so are infomercials."
18262,0,"This movie was a dismal attempt at recreating a crucial time in English history. The film version of Cromwell's growing involvement in the War is marginally accurate but the overall historical accuracy of this movie was way off. This film implies that the war was started over religious differences but the Civil War was in no way Catholic versus Protestant: both sides were Protestant. Cromwell was never present at the battle of Edgehill, nor did he ever "" save the day "". The royalists did not win, the battle ended in a draw. As another reviewer has noted, Cromwell was certainly not one of the "" Five Members "" who were to be removed from the House and arrested.    Overall, this movie was decent. The producers tried WAY to hard and it didn't turn out so great.    definitely could have been better."
18263,0,"What Game Over: Kasparov and the Machine does best is to delve into Garry Kasparov's psyche during the 1997 competition against IBM's Deep Blue. You see him becoming more and more paranoid, and increasingly unravelled, all because in the second game, Deep Blue made a move that seemed too human for his preconceived notion of chess computers. Kasparov thought then, and still does, that IBM cheated. Game Over tries to seem unbiased, but it is clear that the director thinks that IBM cheated. However, they give no real evidence to support the cheating claim, only intimations that IBM's security surrounding the computer room was because IBM really had grandmasters hidden in there overriding the computer on certain key occasions, and Kasparov's assertion that the computer didn't play like a computer usually does at one point in game two. In game two, Kasparov played a game that was designed to trick the computer, attempting to sacrifice a pawn in a situation where previous computer chess programs would have taken the pawn, leading to the computer's eventual loss. Deep Blue didn't take the bait, and Kasparov was so rattled because the computer seemed to play like a human that he didn't even see that he could have played Deep Blue to a draw and ended up resigning. That game psyched him out so much that he was unable to recover, and after playing games 3,4, and 5 to draws, lost game 6 horribly. The question of whether IBM cheated all comes down to that single move in game two, where the Deep Blue made the move that any human would make but that had, up to that point, tripped up computers. Joel Benjamin, a chess grandmaster on IBM's programming team explained in the documentary that they knew that chess computers always got tripped up in that situation, and consequently spent a lot of time and effort programming Deep Blue so that it wouldn't make the mistake that other computers do. If you believe Benjamin's assertion, then the case is clear, IBM did not cheat. Unfortunately, the director quickly moved on and never mentioned IBM's explanation for the rest of the movie, preferring to cut between shots of the chess playing hoax of the 19th century, The Turk, and shots of Deep Blue, hinting that Deep Blue was really controlled by a human as well. As someone who has an understanding of programming, the explanation by IBM makes perfect sense -- if you knew what you were doing, it would not be terribly difficult to put something in the code so that, if thus and so conditions are reached, then do thus and so -- in other words, tell the computer what to do if a situation like the one that Kasparov created in game 2 ever happened. This isn't cheating, it's doing a good job of programming a chess computer. In the end, it's eminently clear that the director thinks that IBM cheated, and the repeated comments about IBM's stock rising 15% the day that Deep Blue won suggest the idea that IBM cheated to pump its stock price ( Kasparov even compares IBM and Deep Blue to Enron). However, there is plenty of outside opinion, within both the chess and computer science communities, that Deep Blue won fair and square and that Kasparov lost because he simply couldn't get past his view of computers as "" dumb machines "" and got psyched out by a machine that didn't seem so dumb after all. I just wish that the director had let us see the alternative opinion."
18264,0,"As a local performer, I thought that "" Grease "" showcased what Broadway producers are looking for and it highlighted a small bit of the acting population. Although my favorites did not win ( but came in second), I enjoyed comparing myself to them and seeing what I liked and where I could improve as a performer. They brought in Olivia NewtonJohn because she is the obvious link between the Broadway production and television audiences. They sang songs from the movie ( "" Hopelessly Devoted, "" et al) because these songs will be included in the new production. I agree with the earlier comment made that the B'Way cast looks so much older, but you must bear in mind that these are people who have been on Broadway and worked their tails off to be there. If the entire cast was green and fresh then I believe that would have compromised the casting process by which producers choose their talent."
18265,0,"I thought Choke had potential, but I thought it could have been a much better film. It had some interesting twists and turns, but some of them seemed kind of pointless. When showing background on the two main characters, some of that really seemed to go awry. Most of it was sort of useless and didn't help the movie at all. This was also not Dennis Hopper's finest hour. However, the main saving grace of this movie for me was Michael Madsen. His performance was excellent. In this movie, he almost makes Mr. Blonde look like a nice guy. All in all, it was watchable. Still, I was left thinking some things could have been done differently. These things would have made the movie much better, in my opinion."
18269,0,"This could have been great. The voiceovers are exactly right and fit the characters to a T. One small problem though; the look of the characters, mostly the supporting or guest characters look exactly the same. The same bored look on every face only with minor changes such as hairlines or weight size. It looks kind of odd to see a really big guest star's voice coming out of a lifeless form like the characters here. If I am not mistaken Kathy Griffin did a voiceover for this show and it looked too odd to be funny. There is a few other problems, one being the family plot. The Simpsons did it much better where you could actually buy most of the situations the characters got themselves into. Here we get too much annoying diversions, like someone having a weird fantasy and then we are supposed to find that funny but for some reason the delivery is a bit off. As you can probably tell it is hard for me to put a finger on exactly what is wrong with this show because it basically nothing more than a clone of the Simpsons or even more "" Married with Children "". If I should point a finger on what is totally wrong with this it probably is it's repetitiveness. Peter Griffin is not really a bright character but neither are any of the others. Lois should have been named Lois Lame because she is sort of onedimensional. Seth Green as the kind of retarded son is the best thing about this show and that is the most stereotypical part on the show. So what more can I say. There isn't exactly anything wrong with this show but in the long run you have to admit that it takes a lot of work to do what the Simpsons has done for almost two decades."
18273,0,"I can understand why others reacted rather unpleasantly towards the climax yielding a twist that really is hard to take seriously. I think, though, that the buildup to it works rather well. The music, quite menacing and spinetingling, really provides a spooky aura matching the unforgiving sound of a constant ringing telephone that is driving struggling English actress, Joan Matlin(Jean Marsh)bonkers. She's borrowing a pal's nice apartment while attempting to jumpstart her career in New York City ( .. the city buildings outside the window look about as realistic as David Letterman's)and is unceremoniously welcome by a noisy telephone which rings quite a bit, followed by loud slams against the wall. Searching for answers regarding the one responsible for such disregard towards her sanity, Joan discovers that no one rents that room, and that a former tenant had in fact strangled herself. Without help from the manager, Joan will decide to find out for herself who is causing her such anguish. Joan discovers the room empty and the phone with a particular female voice which will haunt her. The episode, I think, is a tourdeforce for Jean Marsh who is a one woman show. She's the only actress visible and we follow her through the crisis which slowly erodes her, the phone and the banging from that other room causing her much distress which grows into fear. Instead of leaving, Joan remains, so shaken by the noise and to the breaking point where she just wishes for the phone ( .. or whoever is ringing)to stop. The episode provides a possible answer as to who is plaguing Joan and why. A character named Beth comes into the story rather late as Joan struggles to find out whose female voice it was across the other line who knew her name on that dreaded phone she discovers in the room across from hers. The fate of Beth might just tell the viewer why Joan is being traumatized. I think this episode is an exercise in spooks instead of credibility;some didn't particularly like it, but I certainly did. I will admit that the phone, as a physical menace "" crawling "" towards Joan is hard to take seriously, not to mention it's attack on her, but I thought the intense opening twenty minutes before this were suitably chilling enough to make up for it."

18277,0,"i did not expect to enjoy this. in truth i watched it because a friend knew a friend knew a friend who wrote the script but wasn't credited. knowing Dylan thomas, and really being appreciative of his poetry but aware and rather disconcerted by the man, i didn't feel i needed to see a twee adaption of his lame bohemian life laid bare. and this was not it. critical and yet appreciative it was. it made me cry. kiera knightley was superb, even with that slightly strained welsh accent, and it is a sad tale that they tell. Dylan thomas is not the hero as sadly he was not throughout his life and neither really are the so called ' feisty woman ' of the pr spiel. it is cillian the william of the movie. a man that leaves the woman he loves to fight a war that they ignore. his challenge to reoonnect with that indifference is what is of real interest to this film and what a beautiful performance from that actor. i thiink this film is underrated because it was marketed so badly. Dylan thomas fans will expect something more from their so very flawed hero and get less, and well that is how it was marketed. it is not a film about Dylan thomas and it is much more interesting for it."
18280,0,"This movie didn't do it for me, an avid SNL fan for the past 14 years. Jamie Gertz ' portrayal was OK, but there was something so offputting about the movie itself. The facts presented in the movie are totally skewed. But Merv Griffin produced it, so that would explain a lot. He was never on SNL, nor had anything to do with it. The points in her life when she was on SNL are backwards. When we first see her on SNL, walking through the studio with Lorne Michaels, the logo on the wall is circa 19881989, not 1975.

18283,0,"I thought this movie was really good. It ends up showing the viewers in the end that Leila should of kept what she had. Leila was sick of her husband Jim, who was more worried about work then her. He was so into his work that he forgot their anniversary. He was also very sloppy. She couldn't take it anymore so she left to see if he would miss her. The movie shows that he misses her, he even tries to make up for the night he messed up. He goes to her and tries to bring her home. She ends up finding another man named Schuyler. He seemed like the man she always wanted neat and notices her. In the end she sorta foreshadows by when she look at Schuylers shoes and the way he let his cigar ashes fall on the floor the way Jim did the same kinda thing. Jim ends off making lots of money and cleaning himself up. Leila thinks in the end that she should of kept her husband because that s all she really wanted and he did changing."
18285,0,"I have noticed that a lot of films that have been featured on "" Mystery Science Theater "" have received a tons of low ratings on IMDb. However, a few of the films featured on the films weren't that bad and it's not fair to rate a film that's been given the "" MST "" treatment -- with the hosts making funny comments during the film. Now I am NOT saying that "" The Girl in Lover's Lane "" is a great film, but it's not nearly bad enough to merit its current IMDb score of 2.1. The film begins with Bix and Danny meeting. Bix is a veteran drifter and Danny a younger guy who seems to have no particular reason to be wandering about the country. Once they blow into a small town, Bix needs to rescue Danny again and again because Danny is quite naive -- a nice way of saying he has the intellect of a tomato. Along the way, something happens to the selfassured Bix -- he finds a nice young lady and finds the lure of staying put pulling at him. And, in an odd subplot, Jack Elam plays a supercreepy sicko who wanders the town scaring the crap out of everyone -- yet oddly, the police don't seem to take much notice nor does anyone on their own do anything about him. Ultimately, however, when Elam puts the moves on a girl who Bix is falling for, things come to a full boil. Overall, while not at all a great film, there were many interesting plot elements in this film -- enough to merit a score higher than 2.1. The biggest negatives are a simplistic conclusion to the mystery that occurs near the end as well as the total stupidity of Danny one time too often. Considering the minuscule budget, however, it's a watchable little film."
18295,0,"This is the type of film that makes you question your past admiration for a particular director before you stop and remind yourself that there are very few people whose body of work doesn't contain a few clunkers. The casting in Lelouch's films is of utmost importance because he puts the viewer into such intimacy with the characters. The actors have to bring real screen magic to live up to the intensity. Otherwise it is just hollow.    None of the actors in this film had any of that screen magic, in my opinion. Jeremy Irons and Patricia Kaas fell far short as the leads. Irons is a talented actor but he was wrong for this part. Lovable rogue didn't suit his strengths. His brand of charm also hit a false note for me here. Iron's persona is too decadencetinged to fit into a Lelouch love story. Although I would hesitate to pass up any opportunity to hear an English accent, I also think an American actor would have worked better in this role. So many of the songs that Kaas sings are so closely identified with the Americanness of the particular lyricist that it seemed kind of discordant to then have Jeremy Irons playing the love interest -- even though logically it really didn't matter. It still screwed up the flow of the movie somehow. At least for me. Of course, it would have had to have been the right American. I think George Clooney would have been great in the part. And he would have brought the screen magic in spades. Brad Pitt could also have done a really good job delivering his particular combination of charming and edgy. I was also very disappointed with Patricia Kaas. In reading about her, I've learned that she has a hugely successful career as a singer and many fans, so what do I know, but I found her screen presence as a singer very boring. She was actually a much better actress in her speaking scenes than she was a singer in those scenes in which she had to interpret and sell a song. Nothing she sang moved me. She was pleasant but bland. In contrast, someone like Kate Hudson, who is not a professional singer and has only voicecoach French still would have handled this part a million times better. Not to mention all that stunning French talent out there that could have been tapped into. It was wrenching watching Patricia Kaas take up screen space when there are so many charismatic French actresses who could have been cast instead.    The music was so important in this film, it could not really work without the music working. And since Kaas delivered so poorly in this respect, the movie never really had a chance. Lelouch sealed the fate of this movie when he cast Patricia Kaas. JMO."

How Mr. Van der Linde's sudden approval to the mayor's election was because her daughter, knew how to throw the party ... BLAH, Blah. I was hoping that he wasn't that easy to accept it, the director might have just rushed it.    After all of this bashing of the bad stuff, the good stuff's are here to come. The movie was actually quite hilarious at some point with Maribel being clumsy in the kitchen and all, Heidi's attitude, Valentina being poetic with words.

18298,0,"Jack Bender's "" The Tempest "" is an adaption of Shakespeare's play "" The Tempest "". Bender transports the plot from medieval Italy to Mississippi during the time of the American civil war. He includes the slavery problem and the role of revenge in wartimes. Prospero, renamed Gideon Prosper is not the Duke of Milan but a landowner in Mississippi. He learns voodoo magic from the female slave Mambo Azaleigh. He saves her son Ariel, who thus accompanies him into his exile. The island is not situated on the sea but in a swamp near the banks of the Mississippi. There lives an Alligator hunter, a socalled "" GatorMan "", who later tries to rape Prospero's daughter Miranda. During the time of the civil war, Ariel wants to join the Union troops to help fighting against slavery. Prospero does not care about the war. He is only interested in his personal revenge on his brother Antony. When Antony and his bookkeeper Willi Gonzo ( Gonzalo) try to cross the river, Prospero raises a storm. The Union soldier Frederick gets lost in the swamp and finally comes to the island. He and Miranda fall in love with each other but Prospero won't accept that. Meanwhile, Ariel transformed into a raven by Prospero, finds out that Antony has feigned to ally with the Union but plans to betray them. Antony and Gonzo meet Gator Man in the swamp and conspire with him against Prospero. They kidnap Miranda and Ariel but Prospero freeze them and helps the Union defeat the Southern army. In the end Ariel is free, Frederick and Miranda are bound to marry, Prospero returns to the plantation and Gator Man gets back the island. Peter Fonda represents Gideon Prosper powerfully and convincingly while the character of Antony stays rather flat. It was no bad idea to perform the Tempest before the background of the civil war but perhaps the director has risked too much. In some parts the story seems constructed or comical. Gator Man for example does just appear without any explanation. That it needs a kidnapping to bring Prospero to his mind and that he loses confidence in his power shows that Bender tried to make Prospero more human but only made him a weak old man without his magic. Prospero's original authority and wisdom is not made clear. -------------End of Part 1--------------------------"

Beyond this purpose, the show has no value other than to fill bandwidth that would otherwise go unutilized in the electromagnetic spectrum. I feel a greater sense of suspense and anticipation listening to a computerized voice chip endlessly droning out the products of a random number generator. Fortunately, the helpful and frequent music cues will tell viewers how they're supposed to feel, in case they are unable to fully internalize the predictable and shallow plot line. I did find Amy to be a superficially positive character, as she is a role model to young women that they can serve in traditionally male fields. Unfortunately, her totally subjective approach to the law is guided solely by whatever capricious personal guidelines Amy elects to employ, resulting in Amy's trials more closely resembling appeals to the personal mercy of a tribal despot than a true administration of justice. This show is unpalatable in any amount, although this is to some extent mitigated after two episodes by the brain's godgiven filtering processes, by which the show will thankfully leave the same imprint on the viewer's memory as a television tuned to a dead channel at maximum volume."

This is probably the most pathetic movie I have seen in a while, and yet that's what makes it so hilarious. you can tell these people are really trying to act, unfortunately for them they aren't doing such a good job, making it so even lines delivered in what is supposed to be a serious tone come out sounding really funny. Aaron Carter is essentially playing a character quite similar to himself in real life, and still he manages to make the character seem corny and not at all realistic. This movie is one of those movies where everything that is supposed to sound serious comes out really funny and all the things that are supposed to be funny are just so stupid and corny that you have to laugh because you know how hard they are trying. This movie is so bad, it's actually good. I would definitely recommend it if your in the mood for a good laugh."

The old man ( Harold Ayer) who appears in the beginning will be back and get his just desserts. Linnea Quigley may be the Scream Queen, but Cathy Podewell definitely showed the greatest lungs in this film."
18305,0,"In 1932, Humphrey Bogart was a relative unknown -- an unproven actor who was starring in one of his first films. And, because he was an unknown, the movie they gave him was clearly a Bmovie -- a quick film with relatively low expectations. After seeing it, I could see why it would still take Bogart many more years AND another film studio before he became a household name. While the film isn't terrible, it certainly isn't good -- making it more of a curiosity than anything else when seen today. Bogart is a pilot who has dreams of building his own aircraft engine company. However, when a vacuous rich playgirl comes his way, his dreams all seem to go on hold. As one of the characters in the film said, the combination of the two is like oil and water -- they just don't mix. While Bogart is throwing away his promising career, his sister is going full speed on the Road to Skankville -- having met a sleazy guy who convinces her to sleep with rich guys so they can shake them down for tons of cash! Bogey has no idea his sister ISN'T the actress she claims to be and doesn't realize later that the rich woman he loves leaves him for the same guy whose mistress is .... Bogart's SISTER!!! All this leads up to a finale that is reasonably enjoyable. However, what follows is one of the dumbest scenes I have watched in a very long time! By now, the rich lady is not going to marry the guy sleeping with Bogey's sister ( whew!) but because she's now poor and no good for Bogart, she's about to fly away and kill herself. Bogey finds out, chases the plane on foot, jumps on the plane as it's taking off and crawls up the fuselage to take control of the plane and save her!!! This is so utterly silly and ridiculous, I found myself laughing out loud. Up until then, I might have scored it a 4 or 5-this sunk the movie to a 3 ( how one reviewer gave this an 8 is beyond me). The bottom line is that this was a talking and silly film. On top of that, it's all wrong for Bogart, as the action hero at the end and the simpering lover are horrible matches for his persona that was so wonderfully created in the early 40s. Manly and solid better suits the man -- one of America's great actors but clearly out of his element here. By the way, those who love PreCode films and their very adult sensibilities may want to see this one. Practically everyone in the film believes in and practices premarital sex and Bogey curses in the film -- things you never would have seen after the toughened and more moralistic Production Code was adopted in 1934."
18307,0,"Maureen O'Hara is always beautiful and appealing. Here she plays an actress terminally ill. We don't know with what. It is a bit of a precursor to "" Love Story "" in that respect. William Bendix is good, as is most of the supporting cast. John Payne is meant to be grieving but he seems to sleepwalking. The girl who plays the child he and O'Hara adopts does her best with a contrived plot device: Of course! Adopt an orphan. She will live on after the passing of your wife. It's a sweet movie but it doesn't feel sincere. I was hoping to be moved. I was, by O'Hara's gentle performance. But I don't like to feel manipulated."
18310,0,"Imagine watching a slide show where the projector lingers on every slide long enough for you to completely memorize it three times over. Now imagine that the images in the slide show consist entirely of mundane scenes    a small park; and empty tennis court; a piano. Now imagine that the people running the slide show are having a frustratingly slow, semilucid conversation about events that only occasionally relate to the slides they're showing you. Great    you've just imagined the entirety of the film` India Song. ' The film is an agonizingly slow montage of images that do little except to simply scream out` Look at me! I am PROFOUND!! ' with such blatant selfimportance that the images themselves and the movie as a whole are rendered not merely bereft of profundity, but COMICALLY bereft of profundity. The visuals could easily have been replaced by a series of static images as described above, since it is so rare that there are actually people on screen, and even when they are, the people actually move only slightly more often than the furniture. They never speak or interact in any meaningful way    they just stand there looking at each other, and occasionally crying. The most energetic moment in the entire first hour of the film is when three people walk across a parking lot in slow motion. In fact, the visuals could easily have been left out entirely, as the story is told completely through narration. The story is about a woman who hates India because it's hot, and hates people don't hate India because it's hot ( this point is covered several times). It is also about a man who feels that he is entitled to sleep with the aforementioned woman, since she will sleep with anyone who asks her to, but he doesn't get to sleep with her simply because he never asks, and he's very upset about this. So he stares at her as a single tear runs profoundly down his cheek. Later on, he stares at his bicycle, as a single tear runs profoundly down his cheek. Actually, you don't get to see the single tear running profoundly down his cheek when he's staring at his bicycle, but you know it's there anyway, just because that's the sort of film this is. At best, the narration becomes background hum, serving as a perfect compliment to the comainducing visuals. Simply staying conscious through the entirety of this film would require a supreme act of determination. To watch it and actually come away with a serious and meaningful idea of what it was supposed to be about would induce the same sort of migraine as trying to read lengthy technical documents in the dark. This film is perhaps the greatest monument of pseudoartistic pretension that man will ever know."
18312,0,"It's a kinder, gentler Cyborg movie with a love story. Awww. It's not as bad as it sounds. The action, when it is there, is decent and Jack Palance, Elias Koteas, and Angelina Jolie are always dependable. It's the fact that this is a sequel to the terrible Jean Claude Van Damme film, or is that the capper to the Masters of the Universe trilogy? I'm still confused about that. Either way, there was really no need for this movie. What was there a need for? Angelina Jolie. She may play an assassin robot that can explodes midcoitus, but, what a way to go and even though this is her first movie, she still has the presence that made her an award winner."

18316,0,"I rarely give ratings less than 5, but in this instance I must weigh in. Elmore Leonard is a great writer with many wonderful, complex books, original characters, crisp dialogue, invigorating plot twists. Films based on his books go way back to Hombre ( Paul Newman), Mr. Majestyk ( Bronson), and Out of Sight ( Clooney/ Lopez) among others. Even when done soso the films at least have some measure of story essence coming through. This one, .... it is simply not a worthy addition to the catalog. The acting is bad ( I do not know why, because these are very capable people here) and the story is handled with stupidity. The characters are rearranged, the chemistry is missing, the actors and actresses are miscast. Since Elmore Leonard is a really great story teller, I would hope that anyone who does not know his work would be dissuaded from reading his books because they saw this disappointing rendition of one of his stories. The story is a sequel to Get Shorty. If you have not seen that film, do not watch this. If you have seen Get Shorty, do not proceed to this. I saw Be Cool a few years back, and tonight have been revisiting the vid. The first time must not have made such a negative impression because I had forgotten how dismal this sequel was. Fortunately, I think no less of those who appeared in this film for having done so. They probably expected something more. Get Shorty was original and great fun. Travolta I nearly always like, but he is so much better in Tarantino's Pulp Fiction and in the preceding Get Shorty. He was clearly unable to enjoy whatever was going on here. And I hear Freaky Deaky, another Elmore Leonard book, is in preproduction for 2008 release. Hopefully they can pull it off. Read the books. They are almost all great."
18317,0,"The make -orbreak of a love story for me is whether or not I like the characters and also if they click with each other. Matt is pretty unlikeable: aloof, braggart, seemingly lazy, and a misogynist. He's been hurt badly by his dysfunctional mom and this makes him a little easier to take. I guess I liked the details of his dysfunction -- he was believable. He overcompensates by bragging that he'l nail Amy. He acts so cool around Amy that he strikes out twice. When they do talk he can't show her who he really is. She empathizes and then stonewalls him at just the right moments. She seems so mature and strong that the traits of hers that come out later didn't seem to fit. ( For me.) I found her to be incredibly sexy and pretty, ... girl next door pretty, I call it. So I was going to like this movie unless it really screwed up. Funny things happen with the coach, but Matt's relationship with the other coach was inspiring. The football scenes at the end were perplexing. Matt doesn't carry the ball but seems to be a blocking back. Folks, he isn't the right size! He's fifty pounds too light for that position. But I thought his acting was skilled. I measure that by the way I wanted to wring his neck a couple of times during his scenes with Meredith Monroe. The film was all right. Meredith M was better than all right."
18318,0,"This is species already hatching into a beautiful model ( Mathilda May). A smashing baby with an urge to kiss and kill! The movie begins with a strong launch, and infected by a borevirus throughout the middle to end. The weakest spot is the presentation of the basic plot/ story. As you should have compared it, Natasha Henstridge's Species got the same plot, but adds up much interesting side plot and not mentioning good actions and strong clymatic ending. This explain why Patrick Stewart joins the fleet of enterprise in Star Trek Next Generation; he wanted to find more models in glass cage, floating inside HalleyComet. A must see for a science fiction fans."
18319,0,"This movie was a waste of 3 hours of my precious time .. in the first 10 minutes i was already annoyed as i am familiar with the real version on the story according to the torah ( 5 books of moses) ... but i decided to watch it to get my moneys worth and too see how bad it sucked. Well it sucked .. way more then i thought it would. First and for most lets start with the script and characters the skeleton that makes up the body of a movie. If you study torah at all you'll see that the story is all wrong here are some of the distasful mistakes: moses doesn't do slave work because he was in the tribe of levi, moses doesn't kill anybody at mount sinai .. but yet the movie depicts moses being whipped and aaron and himself killing people ... reeeealllly not!. When moses speaks to the burning bush he knows who he s speaking too but the movie makes moses look like an idiot, he states that he doesn't know who the gd in the bush is ... whatever|Aaron knews his brother well regardless of their distance growing up, aaron was known for his calm, composed peaceful nature but yet he is depicted as angry and arrogant in this movie. Moses looks like Jesus in this movie .. how ridiculous .... pharoah the real one was actually and ugly dwarf who sat upon a pyramid of stairs so he could appear bigger then he was and moses was more then 10 feet and in the movie pharoah is taller then him and he s hot with light eyes! The woman of Am Israel ( nation of Israel) covered themselves meaning their hair and bodies and they didn't dance or sing in front of men, they did not participate in the golden calf so they would definitely not dance with a man in public as the movie depicts. Moses's wife Tzipora was married to moses and she therefore covered herself and being as humble as they were did not cuddle or hold hands in public. Batia Pharoahs daughter ( the one who adopts him and saves him from the water) actual converted to Judaism and therefore would have been proud of Moses when he said he was going to go free his people.fast fwd to mount sinai moses comes down the 2nd time with two sets of tablets ... with gibberish writing on it .. at least put the writing in the holy tongue, hebrew or English and put it on one tablet not two sets .. Bottom line is the movie is horribly written, directed and the characters are all wrong .. basically EVERYTHING is wrong about the movie ... The old one is inaccurate as well but its more realistic, and they actors are believable. Am Israel Chai!"
18321,0,"I was fortunate to attend the London premier of this film. While I am not at all a fan of British drama, I did find myself deeply moved by the characters and the BAD CHOICES they made. I was in tears by the end of the film. Every scene was mesmerizing. The attention to detail and the excellent acting was quite impressive. I would have to agree with some of the other comments here which question why all these women were throwing themselves at such a despicable character.******* SPOLIER ALERT******** I was also hoping that Dylan would have been killed by William when he had the chance!**** END SPOILER***** Keira Knightley did a great job and radiate beauty and innocence from the screen, but it was Sienna Miller's performance that was truly Oscar worthy. I am sure this production will be nominated for other awards."
18327,0,"This movie was Jerry Bruckheimer's idea to sell some records. No seriously it was. The thinking behind it is that if you made a film full of pop songs you could stick the tracks on a LP, sell it and make even more money for the studio. You could also release a few tracks as singles and intercut the promo video with clips from the movie so that when MTV play a track you're actually getting free advertising for the movie. This is a good business deal but an artistic disaster because many of us still have nightmares about Hollywood movies from the 1980s and I rate the mid 1980s as the poorest time in artistic terms for American film making and FLASHDANCE opened the door to this "" Let's make a 90 minute pop video instead of a movie "" type film making Jennifer Beals plays Alex Owens a dancer who works as a welder to make ends meet and right away logic disappears with this career choice. Welding is a fairly sophisticated trade, it's not something you walk into and learn in five minutes. There's other gaps in logic like ballet dancing and "" flashdancing "" being somehow similar. ie if you apply to be a ballet dancer and do some hot, dirty flashdancing the male judges might want to meet you after the audition but you won't get the job. it's kind of like saying that screen writing, novel writing and play writing are somehow the same when they're not    But I guess none of this mattered to Jerry when he asked director Adrian Lyne to make the movie. Actually Lyne almost makes a very sexy movie, JenniferBeals is very sweet and innocent looking. Fortunately I sussed out why her face is brightly lit in close up while her silhouette is darkly litin long shots except when the camera cuts to close ups of her heavenly toned body. That's because a body double is used most of the time and frequently the body double is a man! I bet there's a few naughty boys who are feeling guilty not to mention slightly disgusted to know that"

18332,0,"Spike Milligan was one of the funniest men I've ever seen, and a huge influence on my life. This movie is limp and awful, and does his memory no credit. The script is cluttered and preserves too many lines from the book intact ( the leg jokes here are incomprehensible). The actors ' performances are uniformly ineffective, a great cast wasted, and the lead, Sean Hughes, delivers Milligan's belligerent hostilities in a plaintive whine, which misses the point completely. The gentle pacing is a killer as well. Farce should accelerate towards the end. The Goon Shows often did, the novel "" Puckoon "" definitely did, but this film, if anything, slows down just when you want the various elements to smash together in a final climax. Milligan narrated an abridged audio recording of "" Puckoon "" in 1980, with T.P. McKenna, Dermot Kelly, Norma Ronald and Jack Hobbs. Now, that's funny. Ten minutes of that is funnier than this whole film. I believe the LP was transferred to CD, but don't know if it's still in print. There is a movie of "" Adolf Hitler: My Part in his Downfall "" with Jim Dale and Arthur Lowe. It too is a godawful mess, but it's funnier than this thing. It's possible that Milligan's spirit is too rambunctious for the screen. The other reviewers here are indulging in politeness and wishful thinking. This film fumbles virtually every opportunity and never misses a chance to disappoint."
18334,0,"I'd been postponing purchasing this one ever since its DVD release    for one thing, because I'd been somewhat underwhelmed by this director's two other horror titles ( SQUIRM [ 1976 ] and BLUE SUNSHINE [ 1977 ]), but also the fact that the film itself is said to have been slightly trimmed for gore on the Media Blasters/ Shriek Show 2-Disc Set! I now chanced upon it as a rental and am glad I did    because, not only is it superior to the earlier efforts ( at least, on this preliminary assessment), but I also found the film to be one of the better imitations of THE Texas CHAIN SAW MASSACRE ( 1974). This factor, however, only helped remind me that I've yet to check out another such example    Wes Craven's classic THE HILLS HAVE EYES ( 1977), whose 2-Disc R1 edition from Anchor Bay I purchased some time ago but, after all, Halloweentime is fast approaching ...    Anyway, the film manages an effortlessly unsettling backwoods atmosphere ( it was shot in the forest and mountain regions of Oregon)    with plenty of effective frissons throughout but, thankfully, not too much violence ( even if the last of the villains is dispatched in quite an outrageous fashion!). The principal young cast here ( one of them played by Jack Lemmon's son, Chris) isn't quite as obnoxious as those we usually encounter in this type of genre offering    despite freely indulging in the shenanigans one associates with teenoriented flicks and which, by and large, persist to this day! George Kennedy appears as a sympathetic Ranger; though he doesn't have a lot to do, his characterization is decidedly enhanced by making him a lover of plant and animal life. Also notable among the locals is familiar character actor Mike Kellin in a nice role as the drunkard who first comes into contact with the murderous duo of the narrative    his warning to the teenagers, naturally, goes unheeded but he's later able to lead Kennedy to them. The hermetic family the teens come across in the woods, then, is eventually revealed to be hiding a skeleton in their closet. While one of the girls displays genuine curiosity at the intruders ' presence, the rest are openly hostile to them    and, in the case of the burly and uncouth twins, appropriately creepy ( one of them is even prone to maniacal laughter during his rampages); at a certain point in the narrative, the Ranger even offers an interesting explanation as to the nature of their aggressive and generally uncivilized behavior."
18337,0,"I usually really like Lawrence and being in Australia I haven't seen much of his stand up, so when I saw this at my video shop I thought, yeah I'll have a look. I wish I hadn't seen it now. Obviously Lawrence had a profound experience that opened up his mind, and I guess he wants to share this with others but this was neither the time nor the place. This whole experience seemed like a motivational speech in hell, it really did. I believe the catch phrase of the night was "" ride it until the wheels fall off "" which he intermingled with just plain lewd jokes revolving around sex and sexual organs. Don't get me wrong, I don't mind crude humor, but Lawrence lacks the gift of classing it up in the fashion of Eddie Murphy, Richard Prior or Robin Williams. Lawrence was just plain lewd, the only time I laughed was when he relived his experience with the law and his recovery in the hospital. If there were minus points, i would give them ...."
18338,0,"A nice and pleasant movie full of meditteranean sceneries ( Cephallonia is a very beautiful greek island) that keeps many of the novel's characteristics. I think that greek sceneries add something special and magical to a movie. One thing i didn't like at all though, is that the main characters, like ' Mandras ' and Pelagia's father weren't greek actors but foreigners. I mean the actors tried to express the greek way of living, but to me they didn't succeed and it was quite clear. Even their pronunciation when they were trying to use greek words was terrible and that was bad for the film's plot. Irene Papas was really great in her role, a typical example of a mother, living in a island during the 40's, who has lost her husband and tries to live a child alone. John Hurt, Pelagia's father, also acted great. He reminded me a greek in many of his reactions."
18344,0,"Ok, so I saw this movie at this year's Sundance, and I was sorely unimpressed. It took a good fifteen minutes of footage before there was an edit or a line of dialogue that made any sense, and it took another 30 minutes before the hamfisted script gave way to a working plot that wasn't contingent on a closeup of Ryan Gosling's smile or contrived moralizing. After the first 45 minutes however, the script blossomed into a watchable albeit not completely entertaining or thoughtprovoking. The highlights certainly include both Gosling and Morse's acting, Gosling being an upandcoming star, and Morse being an extremely wellestablished character actor with a good feel for disparate emotions. As a sidenote, after the screening I was talking a little smack about the movie to some of my friends when David Morse walked right behind me -- He looks like the nicest guy in the world, but he's a solid 6'2 "" and probably outweighs me by 50 pounds. I removed my foot from my mouth and promptly changed the subject."
18348,0,"It pains me to see an awesome movie turn into some lame, repetitive and lazy series. It is filled with plot holes and the plot is confusing, in a BAD way. Whoever the prick writers were that decided to turn such a great movie into this garbage should have done some research, instead of filling it with oneliners and hollow new characters, and the classic jokes from the first movie OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN. Sure they get a little creative, but its like seeing the same episode with a small twist. Pretty much like listening to Creed, or Nickleback. Kuzco has to prevent himself from failing, Yzma has a complicated plan, but decides to go the easy way to save time and just use a potion, someone questions the monkey and the bug, Bucky appears in the background, Kuzco flirts with Malina, she disses him without sounding like a bitch, Yzma disguises herself as "" Principal Amzy "" and she calls Kronk, and he forgets that she is Yzma. I admit, this show does have it's moments. Another problem is the fact that Yzma looks younger and Pacha looks .... weird. Also, no one can replace David Spade and John Goodman! Their the ones who made Kuzco and Pacha Kuzco and Pacha! Sorry, but i give this show two thumbs down."

I saw The Clearing on DVD but if I had seen it in the movies I would have had to stand up and SCREAM "" HE 'S NOT DEAD YET, YOU MORON! "" The Clearing is another in a long list of horrible movies that feature Mr. Redford. Legal Eagles, Havana, Indecent Proposal, Up Close and Personal, Sneakers, Last Castle, and Spy Game. If Robert Redford told me to invest in something I'd go the other way.    But the worst possible thing you can do to an audience is this. Say you're being kidnapped and your kidnapper has a gun. He's holding it on you for most of the movie. You turn the tables on him and start strangling him. Whatever you do keep strangling him until he's DEAD! Don't just strangle him for ten seconds. Stay with it! Ten minutes at least. But Bob stops too soon, walks away and forgets about Mr. Kidnapper until ....... He gets up, finds the gun and holds it on our hero again.

On the other hand, there's lots of action, the pace rarely flags, and Reeves gets to do yet another one of those scenes where he's stripped to the waist, bound with ropes, and given a vigorous whipping which, needless to say, has little effect on his defiant character."

Frankenheimer's direction is assured, and he gets some compelling performances out of his cast. Someone else has already pointed them out, but I also want to talk up James Gregory and Whit Bissell in two key supporting roles. Both would work for Frankenheimer again -- Gregory most notably as the bumbling senator in "" The Manchurian Candidate "" -- and they do good work for him here. If the whole thing seems too simple in the end, that's merely because Frankenheimer and writer Robert Dozier chose to tell a simple story, and they do it well. Keep a lookout for it -- Turner Classic Movies just might show it again."
18361,0,"The Kissing Bandit was the third and final film that Frank Sinatra and Kathryn Grayson costarred at MGM with. The first two were Anchors Aweigh and It Happened in Brooklyn. And in both Sinatra wooed and lost Grayson. I guess the third time's the charm. For romance maybe, but definitely not for screen image. Sinatra in his forty's films once again plays the nice little schnook only this time in toreador pants. Poaching on Tyrone Power's territory laid out in The Mark of Zorro, Sinatra plays the son of a man who was a hotel owner by day and The Kissing Bandit by night. He's gone and left California for an education and has come back ready to take Dad's place, but in the hotel business only. And where does he learn the hotel business, Boston. Of course some of Dad's former gang members, grown a little old and paunchy led by J. Carrol Naish, want him to lead the gang again. But Frank's just not cut out for the outlaw life. But he does make a good impression on the Governor's daughter, Kathryn Grayson. Somebody must have had it in for Sinatra at MGM to cast him in this after the bad reviews he got in Miracle of the Bells. Frank's in a part that was more suitable for Red Skelton. But since this was a musical, I guess the brain trust at MGM figured Kathryn Grayson had to have a singing costar. In fact the best number in the film are for her, Love Is Where You Find It. Also Ricardo Montalban, Ann Miller, and Cyd Charisse do a dance specialty that is nice. Frank's songs are nice, but nothing spectacular. In later years, Sinatra would wince at the mention of The Kissing Bandit and with good reason."
18362,0,"This film is about two horse traders who agree to escort a small group of Mormons across the desert. Along the way, they encounter a murderous family of thugs who menace the peaceful folks and put their pilgrimage in jeopardy. WAGON MASTER is what I would term a "" little "" John Ford film, as it obviously did not have the budget or scope of some of his other Westerns. In particular, this film lacks the bigname stars like John Wayne but allows some of the usual supporting characters to take center stage. Longtime Ford stock character actors Ben Johnson, Harry Carey, Jr. and Ward Bond have been elevated to starring roles and perhaps the one who came of as "" the "" lead was probably Johnson -- though the other two got nearly as much screen time and focus. This is not a bad thing, as the film worked just fine without the big star -- and is well worth seeing. Now this isn't to say I loved the movie. It was very good but certainly not perfect. In particular, as far as the music goes, you'll probably either love it or hate it. I found the Sons of the Pioneers ' music a bit schmaltzy at times. It did evoke a nice mood, but seemed to occasionally dominate the scenes. I think a little would have worked much better. Plus, with their incessant singing in the background, I kept expecting Roy Rogers to pop out at any moment. Another minor problem is that the plot was amazingly simple and the ending was pretty much a foregone conclusion. However, and I am glad to say there is a ' however ', despite this being rather formulaic and sentimental, the film still worked well. This was primarily due to John Ford's nice, as usual, direction as well as Ben Johnson's exceptional performance. He was able to provide an excellent anchor for the film. Another plus for me is that I saw this in the same week as BRIGHAM YOUNG, another film about the Mormon migration. While BRIGHAM YOUNG was a bit silly and overly "" saintly "" in its portrayals, here the Mormons were less "" perfect "" and more like real people -- with foibles and personalities. Oh, and speaking of BRIGHAM YOUNG, it seems as if Jane Darwell was the ' go to ' girl for Mormonthemed films during this era, as she was a major supporting character in both films. Considering that she died in BRIGHAM YOUNG and it was set about 20 years before WAGON MASTER, this is some stunt! Also, if you'd like to catch a glimpse of the famous Jim Thorpe, he's in a tiny role where he plays the impassive Indian dancing next to Jane Darwell around the camp fire."
18364,0,"The Box is a film with great potential, but the makers totally misused that potential. The film seemed to take for ever, because of the boring family dinners and scenes about school and jobdialogs between the action. Those scenes could and must be deleted in my opinion to keep up the tensity and thrill. The philosophy of human free will has potential and seems to referring to the philosophy of Thomas Hobbes ( 15881679), but we find ourselves regretfully struck with magic and nosebleeds, were even Harry Potter would flunked his class with! Probably the best part was that moment when Norma Lewis ( Cameron Diaz)has been shot to death, by her loving and caring husband as an act of human free will. I wonder how Hobbes would react if he could ..."
18367,0,"While everyone does a decent job in this film, I agree with the other comment: it's too loose and scattered, too much like a scriptless experiment with really talented actors. As such, it isn't enough to hold your attention. Having said that, there are a few really funny moments, one involving Dylan McDermott and a flaming shot glass that I think anyone who's been that drunk would find as funny as I did; the other is a splitsecond with an inflatable dinosaur. Crispin Glover does his usual nutty twitchfest guy and does it fine, Harry Dean Stanton does his usual nutty patriarch ( Repo Man, anyone?) etc. Good cast, not enough to keep it going. Just a few gems, seconds long."
18368,0,"The film quickly gets to a major chase scene with ever increasing destruction. The first really bad thing is the guy hijacking Steven Seagal would have been beaten to pulp by Seagal's driving, but that probably would have ended the whole premise for the movie. It seems like they decided to make all kinds of changes in the movie plot, so just plan to enjoy the action, and do not expect a coherent plot. Turn any sense of logic you may have, it will reduce your chance of getting a headache. I does give me some hope that Steven Seagal is trying to move back towards the type of characters he portrayed in his more popular movies."
18373,0,"Don't watch this movie expecting the Jane Austen wit, crisp dialog or clever social commentary. This time around, the premise of Northanger Abbey has been updated in a very sensual way!    In this version, Catherine's erotic daydreams are not just silly fantasies, but a connection to the world of adult sexuality she is just peeking into with her daylight adventures. By day she is very prim and demure, and her swain Henry treats her with the utmost courtesy. But as her own sexual nature awakens, her daydreams shift every so subtly from mild to steamy to lurid!    At the beginning of the story, Catherine's visions of sex are based entirely on the Gothic novels she devours in bed. It is both heartwarming, sexy, and provocative to observe the way her dreamy picture of handsome Henry "" dissolves "" into a lurid dream of being carried off and ravished by romantic villains! At the same time, it is wry and touching to cut back to her bed in the morning -- Catherine sleeping peacefully looks so innocent one would never guess what really goes on in that pretty little head!    Later, after being invited to Henry's castle, Catherine overhears a family argument and totally misunderstands its meaning. Jumping into bed, she covers herself up with the bedsheets and lies awake listening fearfully, her striking blue eyes the only visible sign that she is alert. Little by little, however, those pretty blue eyes droop and close as she drifts into another heated dream of innocent desire. This time, Catherine dreams she is in Elizabethan times, waiting fearfully outside the castle for the approach of the "" banditi! "" It's pretty clear she is more excited than terrified by the idea of being carried off by bandits. She all but shudders with excitement and anticipation! But then, after a shot of her running frantically to escape, we are back to the daylight world, where the maid is scolding her for having made a mess of her room before falling into a sound sleep. It's worth noting that Catherine's heavyeyed yawning in the morning light is itself a rather sensual symbol of how passionate her dreams have been!    Ultimately, of course, Catherine's stern and unimaginative lover Henry divines the nature of her fantasies and gives her a stern lecture. It's interesting that Catherine's immediate collapse into tears symbolizes not a retreat but an advance into adult relationships. In the next scene, she tearfully burns her Gothic romance and throws herself shamefaced and sobbing onto the bed. Significantly, this turning point is also marked by Catherine falling into a deep sleep -- except that this time, there are no dreams of make believe passion. Presumably, Catherine has matured enough to be ready for the real thing. Though Katherine Schlesinger has lovely blue eyes and a lively expression, and all her performance is charming, it must be said that outside of the heated dream sequences this movie adaptation is excruciatingly dull. I'm giving it 9 stars only because the truly romantic may enjoy it purely on a daydream level. If you'd like to read a book about a genuinely strong willed young heroine who overcomes real darkness and danger in a real Gothic setting, I highly recommend THE PERILOUS GARD by Elizabeth Marie Pope."
18374,0,"Although Humphrey Bogart got star billing in King Of The Underworld, I'm willing to bet he didn't thank Jack Warner for it. In fact this film was one hollow crown. King of the Underworld was supposedly a remake of the Paul Muni film, Dr. Socrates, but given Humphrey Bogart was in the cast, the character is written more like Duke Mantee in The Petrified Forest. He even has an English writer along in the person of James Stephenson. Kay Francis and John Eldredge are a pair of married doctors and Eldredge pulls off a tricky bit of surgery on one of Bogart's henchmen. Bogey's a man who appreciates good work done on his behalf and gives Eldredge$ 500.00 and there's more where that came from if he plays his cards right. Eldredge who has a gambling problem sees a good way to get some undeclared income.    But when he's killed in a raid on the gang's hideout, Francis is also thought to be involved by the law and the American Medical Association no matter how much she protests her innocence. It's no good and she and her aunt Jessie Busley move to a small town to get away from the notoriety. Of course the notoriety and Bogart and an itinerant Leslie Howard like writer in Stephenson all meet up with her again. But Kay is plucky and resourceful to say the least. Bogart's character was ridiculous, no wonder the poor guy was screaming for better parts. He's a gangster who both shoots down people without mercy and gives his henchmen hotfoots just for laughs. He's concerned about his image and therefore kidnaps writer Stephenson to ghost write his autobiography and of course confesses enough to burn him in all 48 states. And then let's Kay Francis completely outsmart him, hard to believe he was king of anything. Definitely one of the lesser works for either of the stars."

Jean Dujardin is Agent OSS 117, a man who wouldn't know a clue if it hit him upside the head. He is also a reflection of the colonialist attitude indicative of the West. All of the Russian spies, Nazis, and Muslim radicals around him are just as stupid, but there is Larmina ( Brnice Bejo) and the Princess ( Aure Atika) to keep things interesting. OSS 117's uncanny ability to pick up languages, play musical instruments the first time he picks them up, and sing like a native are all more impressive than Bond's tricks, but he is still stupid."
18394,0,"I just saw this at SIFF, and I absolutely loved it. There were parts where I laughed so hard I couldn't catch my breath. The script and direction by Glenn McQuaid are fantastic. I can't wait to see more from this talented young man. The performances make the movie. Larry Fessenden and Dominic Monaghan are just delightful as the graverobber Willy and his apprentice Arthur. Ron Perlman turns in a fantastic performance ( as usual) as a lessthansympathetic jailhouse priest. Bonus: Angus Scrimm as an unscrupulous doctor! As always, he balances menace and humor perfectly. This is a style of horror comedy that really hasn't been seen since Vincent Price did "" Comedy of Terrors, "" "" The Raven, "" and "" Theater of Blood. "" The movie is genuinely scary in places, then it'll suddenly flip back into hilarious mode, keeping you totally off balance. Some parts are scary and funny at the same time. I can only afford to see three movies at SIFF this year, but even if the other two are awful, "" I Sell The Dead "" was worth the price of all three. I'm going to be looking for more movies from Larry Fessenden's Glass Eye Pix. He's giving the horror genre a muchneeded kick in the butt."
18396,0,"Ocean's Twelve: just plain stupid, bad and nothing compared to the other two. An art robbery. 10 known actors, at least. A weak script and very slow developing idea. That's why I characterize a movie I only saw at least 20 minutes of it. Don't get me wrong, you may like it. But I only like the Ocean's films because of the Heist theme. If Ocean's 12 it's not about Heist then what's the point to see it? Glad Soderberg saw his main error and redeemed himself by making a film far superior to the first one. Kudos for that. Steven Soderberg isn't really a good director. Apart from his hit "" Sex lies and videotapes "" ... nothing else happened so much great to the career of this director. Shame on him. But his fault only."
18398,0,"** MAJOR SPOILERS** Watchable only for the action sequences not the story or acting in it "" Nature Unleashed: Fire "" has one of the longest and excruciating endings in modern motion picture history. We have the fearless Ranger Jake, Bryan Genesse, leading this trio of hysterical bikers to safety in of all paces an explosive fume beaching mine shaft! This during a raging forest fire! It seems that Ranger Jake with all his knowledge of the great outdoors didn't realize that a mine shaft that's leaking with dangerous and explosive methane gas is the last place to go when all the woods around it is on fire!*** SPOILERS FROM THIS POINT ON*** All this started some time ago when Ranger Jake in an effort to save the not that on the ball miner Tiny, Chris Harz aka "" The Sherd "", let him slip through his fingers and fall to his death at the bottom of the mine shaft, or did he! Even though we were kept in suspense to who's setting the forest fires for the first half of the movie it wasn't a surprise at all the Tiny was the culprit! As you would expect in movies like these Tiny seemed to be made of hardened steel in that nothing that ever happened to him, fires explosions as well as impaling, could stop the crazed miner. Before Tiny's reappearance, or resurrection, Ranger Jake got involved in rescuing bikers Chris Mel Sharon & Marcus, Josh Cohen Melanie Lewis Anastasia Griffith & Ross McCall, who were trapped in the woods with fires breaking all around them. Having the usual know it allMarcusamong the bikers things don't go as smoothly as Ranger Jake wanted them to go. Marcus not only eggs on the meek Chris to do something stupid, jump with his bike over a 10 foot pile of logs, but has the guy break his leg. This makes it almost impossible for Ranger Jake to have Chris airlifted out before the fires consume him as well as his fellow bikers! For the remainder of the movie Ranger Jake, who put himself in charge, makes boner after boner in his attempt to save himself and the trapped and lost in the woods bikers! All this ends with Jake's brilliant idea to hide in a dangerous and abandoned mine shaft with the rescue party just yards away from rescuing them if they only stayed put and in the open where the rescue team could find them! Even though he was supposed to be the life of the party, or movie, Tiny for all his efforts in being another indestructible super villain came across as a man who spent too much time out in the sun. The makeup job on Tiny was so outrageous that he looked like he dumped a jar of spaghetti sauce over his head instead of having it burned to a crisp. Ranger Jake came across as either somewhat very naive or retarded in his being so taken in by the dangerous Tiny in always trying to save the rampaging psycho who never hid his feelings about what he had in mind for the play by the rules Forest Ranger. In fact Ranger Jake actually encouraged Tiny to do both him and the bikers in by showing him how incompetent he was in trying to save them. The fact that Ranger Jake was successful wasn't because he was so smart but because Tiny, despite his indestructibility, was so brainless!"
18402,0,"The film is a remake of a 1956 BBC serial called'My Friend Charles ', & as such gallops thru the material in a relatively short time. I found it fast moving, enjoyable & unpretentious. Did anyone else notice the scenes, towards the end, where John Mills was being gassed?-the producers obviously decided to omit the scenesmaybe censorship?,but notice when he's sat by the window of the flat, deep breathing closely followed by similar scenes with the car window open. The Francis Durbridge serials all seemed to inhabit the same universe, that of unexplained happenings, people being not what they seem & the villain being someone close to the hero/ victim. A predictable universe in some ways, but one with its own rules & regulations."
18404,0,"Curse of Michael Myers is a very frustrating piece to deal with for a fan of the Halloween series. After a very disappointing letdown in Halloween 5, the series reached a near ebb in plot lines, with a silly devolution into witchcraft and a teenage cult dedicated to the worship of Michael Myers. "" Curse of Michael Myers "" ups the ante in blood and gore, but really represents a decay in the series ' integrity. It's too bad to, as this is the last movie for Donald Pleasance as the character of Dr. Loomis. Pleasance has some good screen moments ( precious ones if your a fan of the series) as the now very aged and as he says "" very retired doctor "". Sadly he died before the movie was completed, and it is very apparent at the conclusion of the film that the stories original climatic scene was never realized. Right from the beginning credits, Halloween 6 has more of the feel of a madeforTV movie then that of the blockbuster horror flick that it started out as in 1978. Any loyal Halloween alumni should have demanded more from this film, ... Dr. Loomis and Donald Pleasance deserved more."

18429,0,"This film is enjoyable if you like poverty row, public domain films from the first half of the 20th century, or are a fan of amateur filmmaking. The film splices together public domain thrillers together along with newly shot scenes in which the "" actors "" ( With the sole exception of Redfield doing a near dead on Lugosi rip, all of the "" performers "" are simply dreadful!) attempt to interact with the stock footage. The "" New "" footage is covered with digitally added film scratches, as is some of the already substandard old footage (??!!). As near as I can figure out the plot has something to do with a bunch of strangers being brought together on an island for a will reading (?) This film, while boasting a creative premise ala ' Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid ', is a technical and creative wreck. In one dreadfully over long sequence and injured sailor on a ship describes an abortive trip to ' Fog Island ', whatever that is! The "" flashback "" then incoherently weaves together old footage from totally different eras, and of totally disparate film quality. Unrelated scenes from ' The Lost World ' ( 1925), The Most Dangerous Game ( 1932), White Zombie ( 1932), Bela Lugosi Meets A Brooklyn Gorilla ( 1952) and some other poverty row productions. This is done over an incredibly bad voice over which seems to have too much room echo as if the audio was recorded on a cheap home video camera. The "" filmmakers "" seem to think that they are paying homage to the great actors of yesteryear by giving characters the surnames of famous actors ( Carradine, Zucco, Ouspenskaya, etc .. etc ..). This tactic was done cleverly, as well as subtly in ' Final Destination ' here it's just obnoxious! Bizarre, and painfully unfunny, jokes about Spiderman, Dracula, and Superman abound. Even the old as dirt ' Dewey, Cheetam and Howe ' lawyer reference is used herethis was old and tired when The Three Stooges used it in the 1930s. The film stock and audio, don't match scene to scene, and dozens of different sources are used for Lugosi. The finale effect is that he seems to be getting, older, younger, older, thinner, heavier, younger and older again minute by minute. Oddly the film didn't use this as a comedy subplot and squanders a good chance for comedy. Truth be told though, It was great fun to watch this late at night in bed. Maybe that s what they wanted to happen!"

The only exciting thing in this movie so far was the parting of the Red Sea. And in Heston's versionit was a heck of a lot better than this version. Did anyone else see an atomic or nuclear bomb cloud fade in and out when the Red Sea was being parted? I think I did. Anyway, I MightMightwatch the last part tonight.

18437,0,"There's a unique place in the pantheon of John Ford films for Wagonmaster, Sergeant Rutledge, and The Sun Shines Bright. It was these three films with no box office names in them that Ford didn't have to tailor the film around the persona of a star being it John Wayne, Henry Fonda, or any of the others he worked with. Not surprising that Ford considered all these as favorites of one kind or another.    Ben Johnson and Harry Carey, Jr. a couple of likable cowpokes sign on to guide a Mormon wagon train to a valley in Arizona territory. Along the way they are joined first by a group stranded players from a medicine show and then by a family of outlaws on the run named Clegg. Their stories merge and what happens is the basis of the film's plot. Had Wagonmaster been done even 10 years earlier on the strength of the two performances turned in by Johnson and Carey, both probably would have had substantial careers as B picture cowboys. In the case of Johnson it would have been art imitating life. Johnson was a real rodeo cowboy and came to Hollywood with a string of horses for John Ford to use in Fort Apache. Ford was struck by his presence and the rest is history.    But the day of the B western was drawing to a close and Johnson and Carey had great careers as two fine character actors. Ward Bond plays Elder Wiggs leader of the Mormons. Bond is a recent convert though and has trouble remembering to not use some four letter words. But he's the leader because of his strength of character, not his impeccable LDS theology. He turns out to be a wise and compassionate leader. In portraying the Cleggs, Ford only had to reach back four years to his My Darling Clementine. They are the reincarnation of the Clanton gang and pure evil. In fact if Walter Brennan who after My Darling Clementine refused to ever work for Ford again was willing I could easily see him being cast as Shiloh Clegg the head of the family. As it was Charles Kemper did a fine job, this is probably the role he's most noted for. Shortly after this film was done, Kemper was killed in automobile crash. He might very well have worked for Ford in the future. Ford makes the Mormons pacifists here and I don't recall that pacifism was part of LDS doctrine. Nevertheless it works here, the whole idea being that these people who carry no weapons are innocents when dealing with evil people like the Cleggs. It takes some gun toting cowboys to properly dispose of them. I think that this post World War II film is trying to say that pacifism isn't always the best policy.    Another carryover from My Darling Clementine is Alan Mowbray playing the same kind of role he did there as head of the medicine show troupe. Part of that troupe is Joanne Dru who's doing another turn as a woman of elastic virtue the same as she did in Red River. Dru used to do so many westerns that she longed to be out of gingham and into some modern fashions. Wagonmaster is great entertainment and I'm willing to wager in the state of Utah it's a pretty popular film."
18446,0,"I absolutely love standup comedy. I love to hear the raw thoughts of the standup on stage, as they are appealing to an audience of their peers different life experiences they have had, or things they have thought up or seen that they just thought were so**** ing stupid that they had to share it with someone.    There used to be standups who took on a persona that everyone could relate to ( Rodney Dangerfield comes to mind) or were just so damn crazy that you couldn't help but laugh with them as they laughed at others ( Richard Pryor). And then, there were the thoughtprovoking comics like George Carlin, who, despite pretending to be a loon, was the smartest guy in the room, who appealed to people to rethink things they saw when they walked around, and realize just how screwed up things were, and how easily they could change things. Now, this might seem to not have anything to do with "" Mind Of Mencia, "" which, as I agree with most commentators here, is Comedy Central's horrid solution to the loss of "" Chappelle's Show, "" but it does. Carlos Mencia spends half of the show doing standup bits for his audience, sometimes on popular topics, most of the time on just racism and racial stereotypes. He tries to be all three of the above types of standups. He makes a stage character, an everyday Mexican named Carlos who, despite stereotypes, is just your runofthemill normal guy. He then proceeds to try to laugh at others, people he calls racist or just those that disagree with his opinion. And then, finally, he presents skits to the studio audience and the viewer, telling them that it will help them see his point of view. Carlos Mencia always says he's showing a point of view that people don't see, yet what he is really doing is not only promoting racist stereotypes that already exist and have been joked about to death, but he stupidly encourages people to hear them and do the one thing that helps keep them around: laugh. Promoting stereotypes is usually the lowest, yet easiest, way to get laughs in standup. The best comedians, which, I fear, Carlos Mencia feels he is in good company with, don't have to resort to them. They talk universally, and ask you to laugh AT absurdity, rather than with it, like Mencia encourages. As he creates more skits or "" reallife "" situations that call for racism or the bashing of others with the use of it, he tells us, rather than asks us, to laugh, and actually presents these absurdities as truth, rather than just extremes of it.    His show is an insult to the minds of those who watch it. Mencia doesn't give us comedy and ask us to digest it and take from it what we want ( something that, as much as I hate to compare the two, was "" Chappelle's Show's "" finest quality) he tells us exactly how we should view it and react to it --- which, according to him, is to make a stupid face and say "" Dee Dee Dee! "" This show is appropriately named. It is indeed a show about "" The Mind of Mencia. "" It's Mencia's mind, through and through, and, as such, is nothing more than dumb entertainment. The show is tailormade to give life lessons to its core audience, 1424 year olds, about how stereotypes are bad, but that racial bashing is alright to Carlos Mencia, and therefore should be alright to you!"
18457,0,"Tarzan, the environmental awareness leader, faces four trappers who by most unorthodox means abduct animals to get them to Zoos. Tarzan has a bland but sexy enough wife with an impeccable hairdo, and a kid. No one should fault Tarzan for being grieved by the vicious actions of the hunters. This Gordon Scott Tarzan flick is one of the silliest, completely and unnecessarily silly; for one reason or another, the team did not find anything charming to sustain the movie, and so it's just some silly rubbish. Tarzan and his family are threatened by a group of evil trappers, because Tarzan's environmental awareness brought him into open conflict with the evildoers. The kid and the chimpanzee, both belonging to Tarzan, are kidnapped by the malevolent trappers; so Tarzan summons the unleashed animal forces of the jungle to release the kid and the chimp with Tarzan leading the attack. TARZAN AND THE TRAPPERS is silly, unappealing, quite uninteresting. Maybe as a kid I would have liked it? Now one has to be too mean as viciously mean as those pathetic trappers punished by Tarzan to ask a Tarzan flick not to be silly; this I concede. But one is also truly entitled to ask these Tarzan flicks, however silly, to have and to show some gusto a bit of gusto even a tiny bit of gusto. Some kick, some excitement, some fun. Now the Gordon Scott Tarzan failure is too silly exactly in the sense of not having any gusto at all, of lacking all excitement. ( Yes, I liked the sequence of the jungle beast eating a snake. What beast? Watch the movie, kiddos, now here I just gave you one excuse to do so.) For one reason or another, the villains look somewhat pathetic and elicit mercy rather than virtuous anger. The books leave the impression that Tarzan seemed quite bright in his own way; and if finding a decent bodybuilder or another sportsman to look clever enough for the role might prove a too demanding, next to impossible task, Gordon Scott was anyway too far from meeting that ideal. The wife chides Tarzan for disliking books. The script suggests Tarzan was uneducated, almost illiterate, and adverse to learning; but the book says otherwise, and we know that Tarzan studied much, by himself, using the books of his gone family, before even meeting white people. And I did not like that yell. ( It's supposed, dear kiddos, to be a genuine wild yell, not a missed yodeler.)"
18459,0,"I am sure I'm in the minority ( I know I am among my friends), but I found this movie long, boring and gratuitous. The fact that the role played by DENIS LEARY is the most likable character ( the only other time I liked him at all was in "" A Bug's Life ""!) speaks volumes. Rene Russo's character was irritating beyond belief and Thomas Crowne himself was flat and stereotypical. To say he was twodimensional may be a little generous. ( No, the scenes with his psychiatrist did NOT help make him real.) With the exception of two wonderful scenes ( both involving the museum caper and NOT involving Rene Russo), this movie made me wish I were at home watching televised golf."
18466,0,"You know you're watching softcore with the wrong attitude when the poor dubbing bothers you. I'm okay with the crappy lip syncing but the sound mix is really of too. Every time someone says anything it sounds like there's a narrator. Either way, this is pretty much the purgatory between boring French professionalism and the heavenly campy Joe D'Amato flicks involving cannibalism and whatnot. Don't get me wrong, there's a fair dose of exploitation in this one, but there's always room for more. Laura Gemser stars, and that's good because she's hot. It's a bit freaky how at times you can see her bone structure, but she still rules over her white counterpart. You can also make a cool drinking game of how often she takes her kit of. Often. Every reason is good. Every person is good. Every location is good. One scene even involves an entire hockey team, whatever they are doing in Africa. Sometimes the plot gets in the way, and the supporting cast consists of some really vile looking people, but there's enough Laura Gemser for all."

18470,0,"I saw this fine flick shortly leaving college. As I sat there happily watching Alice go from repressed virgin to sexual adventurer, I got to wondering why her sexual encounters seemed familiar. Then I remembered-- Intro Psych 101 Lecture! One of the lectures dealt with the PsychoSexual Stages of Developement, basically the shift over time on what part of the body and its attendant stimulations gets our main attention, as well as the changing emphasis on what gives us pleasure. Alice's first encounter is being bathed, with emphasis on the genitals and bottom. Her next encounter is an oral one with the Mad Hatter's dingaling. I forget the rest of the lecture and the order of Alice's encounters, but I do remember how well they matched. It's interesting to see a skin flick with some brains behind it, rather than the cliche "" I'm here to deliver your pizza. Let's screw. "" I don't see how Kristin DeBell's career could be wrecked by this film, as it was her first film. And Reagan's tiresome hypocrisies had yet to mar this land when it was released, but in a way he and his stooge Meese did affect Ms DeBell. When Meese was staging his antipornography commission ( to distract people from his own criminal activities), Meese hired the services of an antiporn activist named Judith Reisner. Reisner was obsessed with images she perceived as child pornography. She saw the "" Alice "" cover Ms DeBell did for Playboy and promptly announced she had scientifically proven that Ms DeBell was in fact a photo collage of parts from several grown women and the face of a ten year old.

The watering down effect done particularly towards the average script snatched away this movie's place as a would be solid classic. Why water down such a great storyline?Probably because it deals with "" sensitive "" colonial subject matters and the producers do not want to create political heat, just quick profits thank you. The directing, cinematography and soundtrack and acting was good. The screenplay was average. The charm of Connery made up for his wrong Arabic accent and all the scenes with President T. Roosevelt were masterpiece takes. The costumes/ sets here was very good. Too bad we did not get more of a serious historical drama since this is what the story demands. Only for big fans of the lead actors or fans of exotic Romance/ Adventure Holywood movies ....."
18485,0,"A sadly predictable, clichd story about a woman who was no better than she should have been. Sadly, too, the screenplay is by the oncegreat experimental novelist John Dos Passos, from an original by French exotic potboiler Pierre Louys. This time Marlene Dietrich is Concha, a manipulative, coldhearted Spanish beauty. Don Pasqual ( Lionel Atwill) raises her from the cigarette factory, but she ditches him. He warns his tall young friend Antonio ( Cesar Romero) against her, but to no avail. A duel ensues, Concha reproaches Pasqualito for trying to kill the only man she ever cared for, so he doesn't: he points his pistol at the sky, but Antonio shoots him. But instead of going off to Paris with the young victor, she goes back to the man who would have died for her. With an unexpected bit by Edward Everett Horton as a Spanish Governor. Dietrich plays the part of a Spanish woman by moving constantly, twisting at the waist and posturing and then twisting back, flouncing, tossing her head, and so forth. And she makes faces, and has a curl in the middle of her forehead. The photography is strangely crowded: no outdoor scene can be shot except through a tangle of bare trees, no interior scene can be shot without so much busy detail that it's almost impossible to follow people moving across a room, no consecutive scene of Dietrich can be shot without a major wardrobe change. The carnival scenes are so full of confetti and streamers it's almost like an underwater scene in the Sargasso Sea."
18488,0,"Every movie Quentin Tarantino has made has become progressively worse. I'd like to believe that most people would agree with that statement, but seeing as "" Inglourious(sic) Basterds(sic) "" has an 8.5/10 from over 100,000 ratings, it doesn't seem like the general moviegoing public has any sense. Even his best work, Reservoir Dogs, wasn't a ' masterpiece. ' The trouble is that claiming that you like Tarantino's work has become trendy. As soon as that happens, you get boatloads of people ready and willing to hop on another bandwagon. They will ignore laughably terrible acting, and utterly selfindulgent writing just so they can be part of the exclusive club called "" everyone. "" This movie is so terrible, that I swear it must be some sort of twisted joke by Tarantino to see how much torture his fans will tolerate and still praise him. Like another reviewer has already said: "" Previous Tarantino movies were from a guy in love with other movies. This one is from a guy in love with his own writing. "" I couldn't agree more. This movie is nothing more than selfindulgent and injoke riddled writing paired with acting ability taken right out of a high school play. But, thanks to the general movie going public, I'm sure it will still go down as one of the best movies ever made. Bravo, Tarantino. You've pulledoff one of the best practical jokes of all time."

The couple tries to escape Wolf, Stefan gets hooked with dope and jealousy for Estelle, who's groovy and a free spirit. Great photography and music, plot is quite usual for the period but it's not an exploitation kind of movie, cold and dramatic. The moral is quite strong ( he was looking for the sun ...) but I would not say it's a film against drugs even it puts enphasy on drug use."
18490,0,"I hadn't seen this in many years. The acting was so good as I began this time, I thought, "" Great! Another movie I misjudged as a foolish young man. "" But then the theme started to be clear and I felt the same way. This was Hollywood, the seat of glamor; so the concept shouldn't be a surprise. But it is so condescending a concept I feel as if I need to take a shower after watching it. In brief, it tells us that even physically ugly people can seem beautiful to each other and even feel attractive. Dorothy McGuire is likable as the homely heroine. She seems to have been filmed wearing minimal makeup. Robert Young is injured in the war and feels scarred. His parents can't bear to look at him either. He seems to have all his faculties and in part, the notions of disability are outmoded. Herbert Marshall is on hand as a blind pianist. His character speaks is hushed tones and is omniscient. The best performance is given by Mildred Natwick as the owner of the title residence. She is bitter and dour but not made of ice. Her story is much more interesting, and believable, than that of McGuire and Young."
18492,0,"This is about as pretentious a movie as a shallow director like Joel Schumacher could make, I suppose. A group of medical students take it turns to die for several minutes; upon revival they discover that their sins have manifested themselves somehow or other. As some of the characters are visited by dead people and some just seem to be haunted by their guilty consciences it's not quite clear exactly what the connection is, but the visions do all seem to look like sixth form art films. Why the students treat their experiment as some kind of grand journey that'll make them famous is a bit of a mystery, as the results are completely unproveable and, as the movie mentions several times, have been documented plenty of times before. Still, it's nice to see Schumacher practising for his Batman trainwrecks with a bit of the old neon paint and coloured lightbulbs. And William Baldwin is a plank."
18494,0,"The horror. The film about the Nazisthe Germans. The murderers of babies, young girls rapists ... For that they regret? What are they interested in doing thousands of miles away from Germany? You do not come to mind is? Fascists are now good Samaritans? Think, killed, tortured, 27 million people. No, of course, they do not want. They were forced to Hitler, he gave each of them, and forced to kill: every fourth inhabitant of Belarus peace, all Jews, Gypsies ... Killing the Slavs. The facts: At the beginning of the Great Patriotic War, when taken prisoner by fascist ( German), they were defiant and brazen. We kill you all, and so on. Since 1943, when they were taken captive, they suddenly became antifascists and peaceful peasants who were forced to Hitler, and personally. For such films should be put to prison for life for the glorification of fascism.    If you want to see what they did, yet went to Stalingrad, then watch the movie "" Come and see "" ( 1985)."
18506,0,"When I was young, I was a big fan of Chuck Norris. I just begun getting out all his old movies on video so I can see them through adult eyes. I remember that I really liked this one in particular, and thought it was one of his best. Now that I'm a little older, I can say that although it's thoroughly average, I still consider it one of his better films. In an acting stretch for him, Norris plays a cop haunted by his participation in the arrest and capture of a dangerous serial killer movie. Serial Killers are all the rage nowadays, and people would like to think of them as a wholly 90s invention. In contrast, it's good to see where the current infatuation has sprung from, most obviously, action movies ( as well as stalk n ' slashers) of 70s and 80s. While Norris attempts at both humour and any form of human compassion are hamfisted and laughable, nobody could kick someone in the head quite like Chuck. Being a big fan of Steve James also, I can recommend this film, ditto for genre legend Billy Drago, as well as seeing Mitch from The Blue Brothers in a supporting role. Not great, but it's better than anything Norris did in the 90s."
18512,0,"Not even original in the plot. Ho hum. There were a couple of angles that could have been quite interesting, but the film follows the path of 90% of Hollywood movies.

He rarely yelled and went much further in his character rather than reverting to an "" in your face anger.

Luis Guzman was actually really good also, except that I disliked the change of his character towards Samuel Jackson at the end of the film. How can one's character center around a dislike for a former cop and then turn into lollipop land within a split second? Is there no original thought left in Hollywood?"

Barbara Stanwyck is along as Robinson's scheming wife the kind of role in which she specialized. Dianne Foster plays their daughter who comes to admire Ford. The Violent Men is nothing more than a "" B "" plot with an "" A "" movie cast but it is very well done."
18539,0,"I was quite impressed with this movie as a child of eight or nine. The gangsters seemed very real and threatening to me, and I could see why people would have been afraid of someone like Dillinger. Seeing it as an adult, it seemed almost comical, owing to the overdone narration and jarring details like Thirties gangsters driving cars that looked like they were from the Fifties. There is a certain gritty, unglamorous reality to the way the criminals are portrayed, but the overall effect is more like a bad soap opera. The most memorable and most unintentionally funny bit that sticks with me is the scene where Ma Barker and her sons are shooting it out with the FBI and the sons are killed. The narrator says something like "" Perhaps in that moment, for the only time in her life, Ma Barker became a real mother "". This is meant to be a moment of great tragedy and pathos, as Ma finally realizes how she's destroyed her family out of her own greed, but instead, it provokes laughter. A very odd film that is rarely shown anywhere these days. Gangster movie buffs might enjoy it, but more as a curiosity than a real movie."
18544,0,"Ugly, heartless Hollywood crap that expects nothing but ugliness and heartlessness from its audience. The scenes WITHOUT Spacey reveal how truly awful the film really is. But the scenes WITH Spacey are just so entertaining that you hang on in there right to the end. Yes, he could play this part in his sleep but he does it so well, he's such a joy to watch, so believable and marvellously monstrous. Enjoy it for his performance, but don't expect anything else from this movie. If you want to see a great film about the evils of modern Hollywood, check out Robert Altman's "" The Player "". This sad little potboiler is not remotely in the same league."
18548,0,"A young woman, Jodie Foster, is witnessing a mafia murder, reports the killing to the local police, and becomes herself a hit target by the mob operatives. A professional killer, Dennis Hopper, hired by mafia, is stalking her to prepare for the hit, but eventually he falls for her. Then, as a parody of the Stockholm Syndrome that defines a case when an abducted hostage begins to like and cooperate with the kidnapper, Jodie Foster falls for her abductor too, make love, and both prepare for a getaway. Denis Hopper, the actor, tries to align himself with the creative ambitions of Dennis Hopper, the director. The result is disappointing, and fails to keep pace with the artistic level of a great performer as Dennis Hopper is. There is no real thrill and the script is sometimes naive and predictable. The film is saved to some extent by the performance of Jodie Foster who is not at her best, but still shines with her talent, beauty and gift. Of historical interest is the short appearance of Vincent Price, and, in a small act, of Charlie Sawn known from his great part in "" Wall Street "". If you decide to spend the 116 minutes to see the film, it is not a complete loss; this movie offers easy entertainment, but we would expect much more from the director of "" Easy Rider "", and the actress who gave us the character of Sarah Tobias in "" The Accused ""."
18557,0,"WHENEVER an idea was successful during those "" Golden Days "" of the Silent Movies, you could bet your bottom dollar that it would be repeated; although "" Reworking "" is the term that is used. Of course one could make the argument that this reworking business has never left us, for success in the Movies or TV always leads to a trend; with all competing parties vying to come up with their own version of said hit Movie or TV Program. TO this last premise we strongly disagree; for this is copycatting or plagiarism, plain and simple. THIS, the last Silent Laurel & Hardy Short, surely must have been quite well received; for ANGORA LOVE ( Hal Roach/ MGM, 1929) was reworked on the Roach Lot, not once, but twice over the next three years. We were treated to LAUGHING GRAVY ( Roach/ MGM, 1931), in which the Goat was replaced with a cute, little puppydog. Also, the weather is transformed into the dead of Winter, in the middle of a blizzard. They also made other lineup changes with substituting Landlord Edgar Kennedy with Landlord Charlie Hall. THE second reworking of the hidden animal premise is the 3 Reeler, THE CHIMP ( Roach/ MGM, 1932), which substituted a female ape from a dissolved and defunct Circus, to which Stan and Babe were former employees. The Circus paid off its employees with their assets and the Boys received the Chimpanzee as their final payday. BACK to our original ' victim ', today's subject, ANGORA LOVE. Recomember? THE short starts off simply enough. The boys encounter the Goat on the street and the Nanny in return follows them back to their rooming house; after Stan feeds a doughnut to her. The comic moments that follow are generated with the interplay between L & H and slowburn exponent, Edgar Kennedy, their Landlord. The incident's impact is amplified by having the interplay occur at night. And as luck would have it; their room is situated directly above the Landlord's quarters. IN addition to the noise, the bathing of the goat, its odor and Landlord Edgar's suspicions about Laurel & Hardy's having another person illegally in the room; we were most amused by a little throwaway gag, which may well have been missed by the Censors. While admonishing the boys about the noise they'd been making and reminding them of the house rules about any unauthorized person's being in there overnight, regardless of their sex. ITS camera shot is made from inside The Boy's room, over their shoulder. With Edgar in the hall and facing them, he warns; "" Remember, this is a respectable establishment! "" Just as he says this, a lady clad in evening clothes walks across and behind the Landlord; followed by a uniformed Sailor, who cocks his hat forward as they pass! POODLE SCHNITZ!!"

It was a really clasic due, it was funny cause abbott and costello were always the same characters, but it was sooo funny, now what i like about jack and the beanstalk is that even though the love story is totally boring and that one song the prince sings, omg, awefull, but i like the angle they took on the love, story, the couple has to get married cause one kingdom is running out of money, they meet in the jail cell and fall in love becaue they both pretend not to be royal and they end up being the couple, so happy ending, i do nt think that was the orginal version, if it was they should have cut it out of this movie, but i think it was orginal and i love it. but watching it sucks, lol, also when the movie really kicks in with the giant + abbott and costello it is sooooo funny. when the giant is beating jack into the door and jack is screaming "" OPEN THE DOOR, OPEN THE DOOR "" that stuff is really funny. And that once joke where jack starts screaming prince, prince and all those dogs jump him. kinda cheezy but really orginal. i wish they would have al least tried to remaster it, though i got that africa screamsjack and the beanstalk, and i do nt mind the quality cause when i had it on tape it was bad quality also so whatever i guess. the begining is mildly funny the middle is really really funny, and the end is not funny in the least, but i am 19 years old and when a movie made in 52 makes me laugh this hard, it rocks, this movie is really funny. i love their style. also the chapters suck. also the part where jack is climbing the beanstalk and they are all singing a song about what a dipstick jack is and that he will be killed, that s pretty funny"

18583,0,"I saw the movie in original Italian. It must be said that the acting and interpretation is most heavily polluted by the TVgenerated trend to speak in a severely muffled voice, not moving lips, straining tones, as emerged in the "" That's real life""-productions and "" Let'sraiseour audiencewithafewtears""-screenplaywriting. The late Massimo Girotti towers upon the other characters for intensity, clarity of expression and intellectual honesty. The movie has some good hints, but ( as in another comment before mine) it lacks a focal point and dribbles away in many plotlets of lesser and lesser relevance, another trend dragged in from the TV productions, well known to Italians. A few drops in style could be spared to the public, such as the patisserie drag ( Charm and aesthetics of cooking plus sensual payload of sweets, see Chocolat, Babette's lunch, Vatel etc.) Hammam and the Fairies are definitely more truthful, seems that Ozpetek has learned the tune of Italy in the early 2000s and is humming along ... I'll give him a last chance though ..."
18589,0,"That distinction has to go to THE DUNGEON OF HARROW. At least Ed Wood's misguided attempt at making a quality science fiction film had the dubious "" star "" power of Bela Lugusi, Vampira, Tor Johnson, Criswell and Lyle Talbot. THE DUNGEON OF HARROW has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. What could have been an interesting and suspenseful plot about a marooned aristocrat on a leper colony, perhaps in the style of THE ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU or MYSTERIOUS ISLAND, is trashed by the heavy dialog and mono tonal acting of amateurs whose lines sink like lead weights into a sea of stupidity. The "" special effects "", which took place in someone's bathtub, further doom this film to the dung heap. Even the treatment of leprosy is something out of a Victorian interpretation of the Bible. The fact that leprosy can not be contracted from an individual in its last stages belies the plot line that the aristocrat Fallon and his lady, Cassandra contract the disease and end up as the original occupants of the Castle De Sade, doomed to insanity and inhuman cruelty. It is interesting to note that not one member of the cast made another film. No wonder, talent begets talent; lack of talent begets oblivion, which is where this film should find its deplorable end."

And "" Zipperface "" indeed looks as if a bunch of amateurs got together for an attempt at a "" real "" serialkiller thriller. It's not quite that, but it's not as bad as it looks, either. Having a woman as one of the two detectives on the case puts a spin on the exploitation genre. Dona Adams gives an appealingly amateurish performance in the roleher obvious inexperience in front of the camera somehow works for her. Plus, she puts up a GREAT fight against the killer at the end. The red herrings appear ludicrous at first, but ultimately they workI guessed the killer INcorrectly.

18616,0,"Pitch Black is a survival story. It's about how to survive in an hostile, alien world against even more hostile enemies. The task gets even more difficult when the nearest enemies can be found within your own surviving group. The plot of Pitch Black is quite usual and has been seen several times before in different variations. But what makes this movie shine above others, is it's wellwritten characters. The group consists of very different people with few more interesting than the others: Jack, a boy with a secret; Fry, a pilot having hard time with her own conscience; Johns, a bounty- hunter with a drughabit; Imam, a holy man facing the fact that God is sometimes cruel and Riddick, a convict and a murderer learning to value others, not only himself. Characters start to live in the movie. They aren't only paper like in many other movies of this genre. You start to care for the characters, especially for Riddick though that feels quite odd. He is supposed to be the bad guy. In this movie, the line between light and pitch black is very thin. All characters are familiar with both. Other thing that works in this movie is the casting. Rarely do actors fit to their roles this well. Radha Mitchell is suitable for Fry. Cole Hauser brings the right amount of cruelness and sense of responsibility for Johns. But the most impressive work is done by Vin Diesel. He does great job as Riddick. In his hands Riddick is quite creepy, definitely very dangerous and also deep character, just as he is supposed to be. So, how do you survive in Pitch Black? Keep your friends close and enemies even closer."
18637,0,"What a surprise this film was. I've seen a good few of Fulci's horror and zombie flicks and was amazed that this was by the same director. He also wrote the screen play which shows that the chap was quite capable of crafting a detailed, complex story line. The dubbing on this is not good, but far from the appalling slop that only further hinders later howlers like ' Manhattan Baby '. The photography in this film is fantastic. A strange, almost futuristic highway appears throughout the film which focuses on a small town where young boys are being murdered. A scene involving the beating of a woman is uncomfortable to watch, yet refreshing in comparison to usual cinema violence.    What went wrong Lucio? Perhaps there is a strong case to suggest he had reached his peak with this film, and it slowly went downhill after that."
18653,0,"Excellent Hitchcock thriller with Robert Cummings proving once again that he could really act up a storm. This time he is a defense plant worker caught up in a horrible plot when his best friend is killed at the plant. Priscilla Lane is the girl who suddenly becomes interested in Cummings as the plot thickens and he is pursued from California to N.Y. There is a diabolical plot by a group of wealthy 5th columnists to destroy from from within. Hitchcock was known to play up the upper echelons of society involved in mayhem in his long career as a director. Ironically, the film implodes at the very end. While we see what happens to the guy who killed Cummings ' friend, we don't see what happens to the rest of the gang, again, many of whom represent the upper crust of society."

The rest of Imaginary Heroes, though, portrayed a realistic family going through realistic issues, such as death, drugs, relationships, and high school. I could have sworn that they were my own family, no joke. Emile Hirsch was completely believable as a teen struggling with his brother's suicide, and Sigourney Weaver plays a mother trying to keep the remains of her ( slightly) dysfunctional family together. Although this family may take their issues to the extreme, anyone can relate to what they go through, whether it be graduation, living up to expectations, or being a parent."

Several of the bad things about this movie are that it has horrible characters, it has horrible comedy, horrible animation, and James Arnold Taylor trying to copy the wonderful, one and only Michael J. Fox as Milo James Thatch. The reasons for my criticisms are that all the characters are changed into something that they never were, and never should be, animation that has been downgraded to the lowest extent possible, and finally, why would somebody who did wonderful voiceover work for ObiWan Kenobi in "" Clone Wars "" want to copy Michael J. Fox? I happen to have an answer to this. Because they are the same person who thought he had to copy Eddie Murphy from Mulan in Mulan II. Yes, sadly, it is true .."
19242,0,"Although it strays away from the book a little, you can't help but love the atmospheric music and settings. The scenes in Bath are just how they should be. Although if you have watched it as many times as I have you notice that the background people are the same in each scene, but that aside, I like the scene where they are in the Hot Baths, but did the men and women really bathe together like that? You could see all the men perched around the outside leering at the women. It also seemed strange that they all had their hats on, but perhaps this was the style at the time. The ballroom scenes were very nice, the dancing and the outfits looked beautiful. I especially liked Catherine's dress in the first ballroom scene. Northanger Abbey looked suitably imposing, but I enjoyed the Bath scenes better. Schlesinger gives a good but not exceptional performance as Catherine Morland. Googie Withers gives the best performance as Mrs Allen I feel. Ugh Peter Firth as Mr Tilney, he just talks a load of rubbish, and is not a clergyman as he should be, it's hard to think of him being in love with Catherine, but then the book never really gave that impression either. General Tilney is played reasonably well by Hardy, and Stuart also gives a sort of good performance as Isabella. Ingrid Lacey did not give a good performance as Elinor Tilney. As for John Thorpe, well he gives the impression of a seedy and lustful man, perhaps not the character portrayed in the book, but I quite like it. I can handle scenes being cut from a book adaptation, but when new scenes and characters are added it usually annoys me. The marchioness! I hate her. She is not part of the Northanger story and neither is her cartwheeling page boy. some of the script is peculiar. When Catherine is asking Elinor Tilney about her Mothers death she asks "" I suppose you saw the body? How did it appear? "" What a silly thing to say! Elinor's calm response is stupid too. anyway please tell me if you agree or disagree with me"
19250,0,"It's common knowledge and has been said before: No one can ever play Scarlett and Rhett like Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable. Joanne Whalley Kilmer ( no longer Kilmer having been divorced from exhubby Val Kilmer) plays her own Scarlett and although this is a sequel and not a remake ( Godforbid!!!) she still can not rise to the occasion ( i.e. her voice sounds evil on several occasions, she's got brown eyes [ Scarlett in both novels had green eyes and even Vivien Leigh's eyes were green ] and her vocal power was not up to the job either. Scarlett is a Southern Belle; therefore she has an incredible talent for flirting ( as she did in SCARLETT the novel and GWTW, of course) and to be a great flirt like Scarlett is, you would most likely need a higherpitched voice, like Vivien Leigh.    I suppose I'm comparing Kilmer to Leigh a bit too much but when someone possesses a role so masterfully as Leigh did with Scarlett you simply can't help but to criticize any new prospective Scarletts. Timothy Dalton should have had no accent whatsoever, due to the fact that both Margaret Mitchell's Rhett and Gable in the film had none. His acting has never been truly noteworthy ( except, maybe his portrayal of the evil, conniving King Phillip of France in THE LION IN WINTER) and he gives very little ( if any) freshness or vitality to his Rhett.     Standouts in the cast are most notably Tina Kellagher ( a born actress with plenty of authenticity in her deliverance) as the tragic victim Mary Boyle. And then of course there's Sean Bean as the cold, calculating and not to mention, almost demonically evil Lord Fenton, Mary's nemesis and Scarlett's eventual violator. One thing I could not forgive the writer for was the fact that Scarlett is raped in this movie ( a fact that never occurred in the novel; Lord Fenton is cold and of illrepute among the Irish in the book but he's nowhere near as heartless as his screen counterpart. Another omission from the novel but readded for the film is the character of Belle Watling, played most horribly by AnnMargret in a cameo role, which we all could have lived without, seeing as how the book was such a runaway bestseller without requiring any assistance from Ms. Watling.    For a film by itself, SCARLETT is a very good one but not quite in that lofty of a place in terms of being GONE WITH THE WINDs sequel. Another actress was highly necessary for Scarlett as well as Rhett."
19251,0,"If there's one word I can associate to this movie, its ' embarrassment '. It must be embarrassing to everyone associated with the movie, to actually watch it in a theatre. Everythingthe script, screenplay, dialogues, song lyrics, directionshoddy, lousy. Saw this movie when I was a kid. Liked it then, mainly because it was a fantasy, a superheromovie. Its a notsoexplored genre in Hindi cinema. The attempt deserves credit, but that's all there is to it. Sashi Kapoor seems to have been in a great hurry in making the movie. Can't understand the reason behind casting foreigners as Hindispeaking characters, who can't even get the sync right ( nothing to say about the dubbing). The screenplay is terrible. The editing even more. If one follows the dialogues closely, one can detect grammaticallywrong sentences ( which completely alter the intended meaning). Nothing special about the music. The biggest embarrassment must be for the Censor board. There are a couple of nipslip scenes in the movie, one of which is absolutely clear ( so much so that I can't even think of a metaphor). The director missed them. The editing team missed it. And the censor board missed it too. So much for the noindecentexposureon screen motto. The officials probably fell asleep while watching the movie. Can't think of why Amitabh went with the role. It might be because he was a good friend of the Kapoors. But the role hardly has anything for him. With wonderful roles in Hum and Agneepath behind him, he couldn't have followed it up with a worse one. There are a couple of heroic scenes, really worthy ones. But otherwise, they're embarrassingly unbelievable ( arrowcatching for instance .. it probably could've been better with CGI, but it was ' 91 ..). Dimple and Sonam do not exactly set the screen on fire. Shammi Kapoor and Rishi Kapoor give an inspired performance, but their scope is limited. Amrish Puri is his usual self in the role of a fairytale villain ( letting out the villainous laugh every now and then). On the whole, an interesting concept. Could have been a lot more better."
19257,0,"When I first saw "" Race Against Fear "" ( don't you just love LMN movie titles?), I had to keep scratching my head. Was this meant to be serious? Why couldn't the main character even run like a normal person running, much less like a star runner? How did I know that the coach was evil only 1 minute into the film? All of these questions, and no answers. Then, I just let the inane script and the awful directing just carry me away ... it was easier not to resist ... then the film became funnier by the minute, and I now rank it among my top ten junk movies from LMN. Some have said here that Ariana Richards is really talented but that the material was flawedI heartily disagree. Not only can she not convince me that she's an athlete, she's walks wideeyed through the rest of the story, like she's just landed on earth. Maybe the coach broke out of prison and finished her off ... at least I hope so."

19339,0,"This is one of those strange, selfimportant, selfindulgent movies which tries too hard to be profound. It isn't. Instead, it spouts cliches that try to pass for Profundity. Typical is the scene where Peter ( Kelsey Grammer) explains to protagonist and best friend Adam ( Dwier Brown) how man starts life breast feeding, then moves on to sucking the breast of his girlfriend, and finally his wife, thus concluding ultimately that life sucks. So deep. We are treated to a variety of characters who offer their perspective of life, the universe, etc. during Adam's travels through the Mojave Desert on foot. ( He abruptly leaves L.A. the day of his wedding and his family, friends, and fiance assume he's dead when his car was found in a military test range smashed by a rocket.) Some characters are more entertaining than others. The best by far is an escapee from a mental hospital who only speaks through the voices of others. The actor, James Kevin Ward, does some great impressions, including Nicholson, Popeye, and several characters from the original Star Trek. But once the interesting characters leave the screen, we're stuck with Adam again and his pursuit of the profound. It's a long trip, which drags in many places. In fact, it's the longest hour and a half movie I've ever seen. And the finale hardly makes it seem worth while, at all. I discovered this movie playing on HBO one day by waking up too early and clicking on the TV. That'll learn me. Next time I'll try harder to sleep in."
19377,0,"I can hardly call this a great film but it is entertaining. In my case I, at the time this film was released, was the same age as some of the junior campers in the film. For me watching this film brings back the memories of my camp years. While some of the pranks that takes place in this movie, like carrying the camp director out in his bed and leaving him on the side of a road, strung up in the trees or out on a lake, are a bit over the top some of the other pranks are not. When I went to camp the campers and counselors pulled similar stunts such as running underwear up the flag pole, canoe battles and boys raiding the girls cabin. As I grew older I realized these night raids to the girls cabin that I participated in were carefully orchestrated by the counselors so that we wouldn't find the girls in embarrassing situations but at the time I thought it was real and it was fun. That's what MEATBALLS ( MB) is.    MB captures not only the scenic beauty of camp surroundings but the beauty of being young and carefree. MB give a great example of preteens, teens and young adults living their summer with no concerns other than guys hooking up with girls and girls hooking up with guys and booth having as much fun as they can before they head back to junior high & high school and college. The opening title song that goes "" Are you ready for the summer? ... no more homework no more books, no more teachers dirty looks ... "" describes exactly how summer is viewed by school kids.    I personally enjoyed the two campers Spaz and Fink. What boy, nerd or jock, didn't spend all camp trying to cozy up to some pretty girl camper? What guy didn't want to be accepted by the other campers and counselors? While these two characters are somewhat over the top I bet everybody who watches the film can't help but to like these two guys. These two characters are a mix of Charlie Brown from PEANUTS and Jack Tripper & Larry Dallas from THREE 'S COMPANY. I would bet that most viewers even cheer for Spaz in the egg carrying competition and for Fink as he attempts to "" beat the stomach "" in the hot dog eating contest.    Lastly, this movie had normal looking kids and counselors. No super models for counselors or campers that wore trendy clothing. It is fun to just kick back and watch this film and remember when life was as fun as this movie."
19396,0,"I approached this movie with the understanding that it was one of the worst flicks ever made. I sat down to watch it with this mindset, and was pleasantly surprised. It's not great. It's not even that good; in fact, it's pretty poor. However, it's not as bad as I had been led to believe, by a long shot. It's pretty inept, and, evidently as a cost cutting measure, a lot of stock footage is pressed into service, a lot of which has no apparent relation to the narrative. What it is, however, is an intensely personal movie made by a man who evidently did not have the skills or the funding to do his idea justice. Before you discount_ Glen or Glenda?_ out of hand, examine your own artistic skills. Me, I'd love to be able to draw, but anything I try to sketch comes out like stick men. I'd love to be able to sing, but all I do is frighten young children. Wood had an idea, and unfortunately he didn't have what it takes to make it work. However, this was an incredibly daring movie for the puritan 50s, however exploitative or incoherent it may appear at first glance."
19401,0,"This one is one of those classic B movie following the exploits of 2 hobos. It's done really cheesily and Big Stupid running off oneliners like a cardboard cassanova. But Jack Elam steals every scene he's in as the creepazoid Jesse ( now Jerome!). My favorite scene is the lynch mob and the dad's voice going up 10 octaves ( "" You loved her? ""). Danny, Big Stupid's protege, is surprisingly stupider, but not as loathsome as our lead star. There's also a quaint scene of a guy pimping at the diner. Joyce Meadows is the sweet, naive nice gal and probably the least annoying. And those yellow ruffles ( RAWR!). Oh, and booze is evil according to Mr. Stupid. This movie's a hoot. Watch the MST cover of this and Crow's terrific Elam homage!"
19489,0,"I tivo'd this on Turner Classic just because it was precode and sounded interesting. When I got around to watching, I noticed that the "" critique "" gave it one and a half stars on a fourstar scale. I started watching with trepidation -- even old movies can be bad movies -- but I quickly got engaged in the story and Mary Astor's performance as the business brains behind a simple salesman's rise to success. Not a truly great movie -- too predictable -- but certainly better than advertised. And I would have liked to have seen more of Ricardo Cortez as the man who appreciates Mary but won't give up his wealthy wife. I'd recommend giving it a look just to appreciate Astor and what a long way we've come, baby."

Its kind of a Chinatown ripoff, but the worst part is that other than Nolte, the other members of the squad didn't get enough screen time. But its a decent movie to see once I guess. And Melanie's role was small enough that she wasn't given a chance to be a nuisance."

Canadians will notice the odd joke for Toronto or the Federal Government, and because the CBC axed a really good show by the Frantics that Dan was part of, the show takes shots at them and in the episode "" Dan's Umbrella "" the CBC is raked across the coals. When Dan says that the CBC would never waste taxpayers money on useless venture, Rocko enters the room and gives Dan back his Tape of FridayNight with Ralph Benmurgue, this show was a flop and most people wouldn't get the joke unless they knew the CBC's history for making shows people don't watch or axing good shows that they do watch."

I can visualize the hordes of traumatized TV viewers, phone in one hand and fully loaded .45 auto in the other hand, dialing out of lastminute desperation before walking off the plank of life to escape the specter of COTB's orangehaired monster echoing in their synapses like the agony of searing, irreversible meningeal swelling."
19533,0,"There were many ' spooky ' westerns made in the 30s and early 40s, and although this has a strong beginning, it isn't one. Randy Bowers ( John Wayne) stopping at a ' Halfway House ' saloon, finds it to be full of dead bodies, the bartender's corpse draped over the bar holding a gun, eyes watching Randy from behind holes cut through eyes in a picture, and a player piano playing "" The Loveliest Night of the Year. ""    It was the result of a robbery by the Marvin Black gang, to get Ed Rogers '$ 30,000. Randy is an investigator who "" works alone, "" who wastes little time in getting arrested, escaping ( with Ed's daughter Sally's help) and literally landing in the midst of the Black gang's hideout behind a waterfall. It all moves along fairly quickly. Only one too many chases after Randy slow it down. We even get George Hayes, clean shaven and playing two parts-- Marvin Black, the vilest villain, as well as the Good Citizen, Matt the Mute, who communicates via handwritten messages. Having him play two opposite roles was a good idea, but the writing down of messages thing gets old real fast, even for him, as he finally gives up doing it near the end saying to Sally, "" Ah, I'm fed up with this! "" You can find George playing a vile, vile, double crossing villain in the serial "" The Lost City "" ( 1934). I think this is the only ' Lone Star ' film in which the title relates to, or is mentioned in the film! Sally offers her hand to Randy and says, "" He's not alone anymore! "" Then cut to their arms around each other as they look out facing a lake. Sally's running off with Randy seems too abrupt and not sufficiently prepared for. Too much time spent on horseback escaping the sheriff. Not that bad considering everything, but not that great either. I'd really give it a 4 and a half."

This should have been a spoof, but it took on a realism that corporations had a lot to answer for. Jim Carrey after all the work he has done is still Jim Carrey and his comedy does not get any better, his co star was not able to back him up. Their son in the movie was invisible. The life of crime was a blink, and that was the missing link of the movie. The film showed 2 or 3 robberies and they were richer than before, that where it lost it for me. I did laugh in some parts butthrough the whole not good enough, AlecBaldwin I felt was there to add some weight to the film. His character was not strong enough. There were just too many gaps to make this a smart and tight movie."

While I did figure out who was going to be killed I didn't figure out who did it. I wasn't happy with the portrayal of the Gerda character but given the year the movie was supposed to take place it is possible the woman would have been that ' cloying '. Please know that while these Poirot movies are good, they just don't have the same dynamic to them as the series does because they don't have Japp, Ms. Lemon and especially Hastings! David Suchet is definitely Poirot. I have seen every actor who's played him. The worst was Peter Ustinov!"
19626,0,"There are several ways to misunderstand this movie and a couple of them have been shown in some of the past comments. This is a movie to be analyzed as a free recreation of a known subject and therefore not to be compared with the opera, the book or other Carmen movies seen before. It just stands for itself and I must say that this Carmen does it very well. It is a mistake to compare because that is the first step to deny movies the chance to be autonomous creative works of art. Vicente Aranda is a master of atmosphere and the art direction, the costumes and the photography are extremely well put together to achieve a pleasing aesthetic experience. Let's take it as it is. And that brings us to the next misunderstanding. Someone complains about the typical Spanish clichs in the movie. Well, historically the movie is extremely well researched and you can see the results of that very serious work in every scene. It is not only an accurate portrait of the "" black Spain "" of knife and espadrille that Goya portrayed so vividly, but it's also of that part of history as seen by a foreigner fascinated with the folkloric side of that society. Honestly, anyone who doesn't want to see any clich about Spain shouldn't buy a ticket to see Carmen, but in this case those clichs are presented before they became one and the way to see them is getting rid of our own prejudices. Another important requirement to understand this movie properly is to speak the language. It is not acceptable to criticize any actor performance for not having understood his or her lines. If all the rest of the audience did, the problem most likely lies somewhere else. Paz Vega has an immaculate diction with her Andalusian accent and all she says is understandable and credible. Her Argentinian partner, Leonardo Sbaraglia, gives also a convincing portrait of the Basque officer that became a "" bandolero "", and her accent is very well learned. No less important is to have a minimally open approach to the material. To say that Paz Vega is "" horrible "" suggests that the author of the phrase entered the theater for the wrong reasons. We already had in Spain a critic in one of the most prestigious papers that used to recommend us pictures he found homosexually arousing, without mentioning it explicitly. And that was not totally fair for the rest of us, especially for the ones that hadn't detected that the man was writing with parts of his anatomy that many readers didn't necessarily had to care for. I'm not suggesting at all that the reviewer had the same motivation, but the expectations must have been different as the ones of those among us that went to see a talented and beautiful actress play an almost classic role, because that's what we got. Paz Vega IS Carmen, and an excellent one, in Vicente Aranda's movie."

This film is best watched with other like minded individuals so you have someone to laugh with.

But the Henry Tilney of the novel is not a snufftaking, canewielding, sappylinemaking hero of a Gothic novelhe is a tease, a nearlyhandsome man with a messy room and a living ( that's right, Henry Tilney is a clergyman, a charm that is completely dropped from the script). Some of the best scenes from novel, when Henry, completely deadpan, outrageously teases the literallyminded Catherine on diction, journals, Mrs. Radcliffe, etc., are not portrayed in the adaptation. A large section of Henry's personality is lost when those scenes are not adapted. Besides, Peter Firth's appearance is not accurateHenry Tilney is supposed to be 24 or 25, dark hair and a brown skin, not 35 or 40 and blond. There are so many other absurdities within the adaptation that invoke surprise and disgustwho is the Marchioness, and what is she doing in the story?! Why is John Thorpe less of a dunce and more of a schemer? Why is Northanger Abbey a castle? Catherine of the novel, with her romantic visions, expects hidden passages and dark tapestries, but is very disappointed to discover that Northanger Abbey is actually a comfortable, modern houseanother element of satire! Why portray General Tilney as a drunk? Why does Catherine have those strange visions of Mrs. Allen threading her finger, etc.? Catherine's imagination only runs away with her at Northanger, with Henry there to correct her gently. And lastly, why are so many facts concerning the Tilney family and Mrs. Tilney's death altered unnecessarily? To make the story more` horrible?

All I can say is, if you enjoyed the novel, stop there, until the BBC creates one of their smart & sensible period masterpieces ( like Pride & Prejudice with Colin Firth, which, speaking for what I imagine in my opinion, Austen would have revered). The BBC would never dare overdub cheesy saxophone solos and Indigo Girl hollers over a shot of an historic castle and a loving embrace.

Hey, he could have at least shaved off his hair and lost the moustache, just for the sake of continuity. Some correctional centres show this movie in order to punish offenders.

So, like Geri Nichols in Death Wish II, Death Wish III scores with its gentle, romantic moments as well as its violent moments. Only the James Bond loveinterest scenes would do much better. And, in addition to his .38, Kersee plays with this new gun called the Wildey .475 Magnum. It reminded me of the Dirty Harry movies when Callahan used his .44 Magnum in Magnum Force, Sudden Impact and Dirty Harry. The Wildey gun packs a big punch and when Kersey kills with it, he doesn't care if the gun has a big kick in it. And that antitank missile that killed off the main gang leader? Well, that is something. Kersey would not use an antitank missile as his regular vigilante weapon .... that is way too military for him."
20056,0,"So I turned on the TV today at 1:00 PM on a Sunday, expecting to see crap and infomercials, and this great movie was just starting, didn't know what it was but drew me in almost immediately. The movie was excellent. there were a couple of things that didn't make sense for one I don't get why the dead guy was talking about doing stuff to get yourself out of your bad situation, but then Jimmy doesn't really do anything except the basic stuff to survive that anyone would do in his situation, in other words it wasn't his initiative that got him out of his bad situation it was just luck, second I don't get the thing about the girl killing the the gangsters at the end, because the whole thing was partly casued by the thief people stealing Panda's money, and then the other thief kills Panda at the end, so they steal his money twice, and kill him how is that good?"
20062,0,"Following his role in the fine caper SEVEN THIEVES ( 1960)    which I ve watched several years back    Edward G. Robinson seemed to be stuck playing elderly criminal mastermind types ( apart from the odd juicy role as in THE CINCINNATI KID [ 1965 ]). I d previously watched the pretty good EuroCult effort GRAND SLAM ( 1967) and, apart from this, I ve yet two more similar titles from Italy to check    one of which was directed by future goremeister Lucio Fulci! Anyway, this is the kind of international production    featuring American and Italian actors and a British director    which was prevalent during the 1960s; its harmless and easygoing in itself but hardly memorable and definitely overlong    especially since to procure finance for the heavyduty equipment required for the heist ( such as an army tank and an airplane!), the gang involved have to pull a variety of minor thefts first. The gang, of course, is an incompetent lot led by an American ( Robert Wagner) and his bimbo girlfriend ( Raquel Welch)    the others are a pacifist black man, a perennially hungry Italian and a diminutive Englishman. They try to induce an exgangster ( Vittorio De Sica) to turn over his fortune to them, except he s destitutebut, under the auspices of Professor Robinson, he proposes instead a caper of 5 million dollars worth of platinum! Needless to say, the gang members do nt trust one another ( Wagner instructs Welch to seduce De Sica so as to get the name of their fence in Morocco    where they are to retreat after the robbery), or else bungle the job ( commissioned to hold up a restaurant, the Italian ca nt resist sitting at table and order a multicourse meal for himself!). Amusingly, in the face of similar failures, De Sica tries to show them how they used to do it in the old days    however, ostensibly holding up a petrol station, it transpires that the owner is a nephew of his and he merely asked to borrow some cash!    The central heist sequence is typically elaborate: while the gang, including Welch, take the train transporting the platinum, Wagner kidnaps pilot Victor Spinetti and his airplane. When the job is done, he fully intends to doublecross De Sica    but neither his partners nor Welch herself are willing to go along with this, so he s forced to relent. Coming from the time when crime did nt pay, the gang contrives to lose all their stash in midair when the planes bombbay doors are accidentally opened"

My guide described it a comedy, but the pathetic travails of these hapless buffoons is not my idea of a belly laugh. More in the genre of the farcical thriller/ drama. The characters developed well enoughan allstar cast made it ohso promising, just a shame the plot was patently absurd. Ted Danson provided a fine cameo as did Jamie Lee Curtis in her walkon part. Jon Bon Jovi has this amazing ability to measure THC content in the front seat of his car! I guess if you imbibe a few beforehand you should be able to sit through this onenot for the gun shy paranoid types though."
20673,0,"It's fun to watch a young James Cagney doing his thing. He plays the cheapskate Weights and Measures guy who takes his job very seriously, stepping on the toes of a group of crooked politicians. He is offered the world, but keeps his integrity. He is beaten and set up, but that's the problem. We never know if he is really in danger. They say he's in a spot, but still seems to have carte blanche to move around and do what he needs to do. At times he's so cocky he doesn't do much to protect himself. His allies are in the police department but just about everything else is pretty corrupt. He perseveres ( almost too good to be true), of course, and we pull for him. The problem for me is a lack of sustained suspense. It would have been much better if he had had to clear his name. He never drops into the depths, even when rejected by his wife to be. It's still fun with the bad guys kind of imploding. See it just to watch Cagney do his tough guy posturing."
20849,0,"There must have been some interesting conversations on the set of Eagle's Wing, with Martin Sheen straight off Apocalypse Now costarred with the actor he replaced on Coppola's film, Harvey Keitel. A real unloved child of a movie, dating back to the last major batch of Westerns in 197980, it was much reviled at the time for being made by a British studio and director ( conveniently ignoring the fact that many of the classic American westerns were directed by European migrs), which seems a bit of an overreaction. The plot is simplicity itself, as Martin Sheen's inexperienced trapper finds himself fighting with Sam Waterston's nonosyllabic Kiowa warrior over the possession of a beautiful white horse, the Eagle's Wing, across a harsh and primitive landscape in a time "" before the legends began. "" Aside from Caroline Langrishe's captive Irish governess, the supporting cast have little to do ( Stephane Audran never even gets to open her mouth) and it is a little slow, but Anthony Harvey's film does boast terrific Scope photography from Billy Williams and a good score from Marc Wilkinson."
20873,0,"If you want to see the true, vile nature of Communism, watch the movie DARK BLUE WORLD. ( Tvamomodr Svet) It recounts how the brave Czech pilots who refused to surrender fled to England to join the fight against the Nazis. After the war, the Communists feared they had picked up dangerous Western ideas about freedom. So, they had these heroic Czech pilots thrown into a nightmarish prison, where some of the guards were the same Nazis they risked their lives to defeat. If Hollywood wants to understand why so many of their movies fall flat, they should compare the character drama portions of "" Pearl Harbor "" with this movie. In Dark Blue World, you really make a connection to all the characters. In Pearl Harbor, everyone is like some slick cartoon version of a real person. There are innumerable instances of brilliant writing in this movie. One funny scene that sticks in my mind is when the character Karel is being taught English by a rather formal Englishwoman. When he can't pronounce a word, he ridicules the lesson. In typical stoic English fashion, the teacher calmly but forcefully confronts Karel, and shames him into behaving. The aerial battle sequences in this movie are amazing, and they help to keep the movie lively. I read that it cost$ 11,000 an hour to rent the planes, but it was worth every penny. Ladies, you are expected to cry at sad movies, but guys .... beware! This movie would make General Patton weep. And if you are a dog lover, you'll use up half a box of Kleenex. Don't say I didn't warn you."
20906,0,"Robin Williams is a national treasure, specially when he cuts loose and puts aside his maudlin approach to drama. He manages to liven up the usual restrained pacing of Barry Levinson, and there are moments in this film when he truly shines. As the funny elected American president in "" Man of The Year "" Williams recaptures the hilarity and outrageousness that used to be associated with him. What makes him so appealing is his humanity and likability. Here is a man who can lash at his audience but truly loves them, too. His humour is like barbed wire, and yet it is cathartic. It is what makes him very appealing to the people in the film and in real life. Laura Linney is once again portraying an intelligent woman in distress. She is a fabulous and very talented performer, but I think she has boxed into a stereotype and unfortunately, it would have been more interesting to have a less recognizable performer in this case. Walken pretty much walks through his thankless role, and the climatic scene in the SNL skit barely floats above water. Go in for a few hilarious moments, and those are priceless. Enjoy Williams and forget some of the deep moments that slow down this otherwise entertaining movie."
20911,0,"Back in the 60's, this grim study of Joy, a young proletarian wife, was the introduction to the career of Ken Loach, who became one of the most distinguished and respected British filmmakers of all time. By then I knew very little about Brecht, politics or the reality of the underprivileged, and I was quite impressed by the aesthetic of the film, its free style, its austere color cinematography, and Joy's monologues in front of the camera. I was also much surprised to find that Terence Stamp ( who had become a celebrity, thanks to "" Billy Budd "", "" The Collector "" and "" Modesty Blaise "") had so little screen time. Although 20th Century Fox distributed "" Poor Cow "" in Panama, Loach did not stay in mainstream cinema ( which this film hardly is) and I lost contact with his films. I just heard of his successes, "" Kes "", "" Family Life "", "" Black Jack "". until I caught up in the 80's.

20997,0,"Hal Hartley entry into a European film series is one of his two or three best efforts to date, and, lucklily, one of the few available on DVD. At only 63 minutes running time, my only quibble would be with Hartley I always leave wanting more, but never so much as this time. Martin Donovan is astonishing as Jesus. PJ Harvey is beautiful and interesting as Magdelena, but the high point for me was Thomas Jay Ryan ( Henry Fool) as Satan. Hartley gives him excellent dialogue and a chance to use his resounding voice to full effect. Look for three scenes in which a microphone awaits him, as if a poetry slam is about to be won by the devil. I have read other comments on this film and had to add mine because there is not enough praise going around. If you like Henry Fool, Martin Donovan in anything ( Opposite of Sex), and/or very clever comedies based on biblical ideas, get this as quickly as possible."
21612,0,"I had borrowed the three Sarah movies from a friend, and had watched them while sick in bed during one weekend. I thoroughly enjoyed every one of them. I enjoyed how the last movie gave a glimpse of what Caleb and his sister were like when they grew up. In addition, I liked the carrythrough of the "" Billyboy "" song that first was heard during the credits of the first movie, the title "" Sarah, Plain and Tall. "" However, the one thing in Winter's End that I didn't like was the youngest daughter. She was a very cute little girl, but she just had too much spirit and looked like a brat compared to the other kids, even compared to talkative but still goodnatured Caleb when he was younger."

How did two qualified doctors fail to notice that Naomi was still alive? How did 30 plus people not notice a corpse wake up and walk off with a knife still in her back?

21615,0,"YOU BELONG TO ME ( 1941) is a example of the ' ScrewBall Comedy ' which started in the mid 1930s and ended postwar ( WWII). Some of these films maintained their status. Others have earned undeserved praise when originally were critical and box office flops. Like BRINGING UP BABY ( 1938) or MR. & MRS. SMITH ( 1941). Then there is this one which value just keeps sinking. Why can be rooted in the screenplay/ story. It strains credibility from the get go, betraying a superior cast. BARBARA STANWYCK is married to millionaire HENRY FONDA who is insanely jealous. He would be content to sit back with his million$ and love her, she wishes to maintain her profession as a Doctor. She wants him to become in what her eyes is a useful member of society. This conflict is supposed to amuse us. It can not be salvaged by either the principals or the supporting cast. The faults in this scenario can clearly be laid at the feet of DALTON TRUMBO. HENRY FONDAs ' character is written in such broad strokes that any viewer has a instant dislike for him. BARBARA STANWYCK just has nothing to do but react to each idiotic situation of jealousy. TRUMBO must have been spending to much time outside the studio being a "" useful idiot "" then being on the job. COLUMBIA obviously did not get their moneys worth from him, maybe ROBERT RISKIN should taken over."

Sarkar is supposed to be a strong character, but the movie shows that Amitabh is too dependent on others power rather than his. There is a movie in Tamil called Nayakan based on the theme of GOD FATHER and Kamala Hassan has played the lead. The movie is well directed and the power till the end remains in the hands of Kamala Hassan, not his son. Amitabh Bachan seems to be too helpless in the movie and he just accepts everything instead of changing things. The movie fails to show the strong impact of God Father."
21812,0,"Perry Mason: The Case of the Glass Coffin finds Raymond Burr defending David Copperfield/ Rick Blaine like magician Peter Scolari from a murder charge involving one of his assistants. A trick involving a suspended glass coffin in midair goes awry and the body of Nancy Grahn comes a tumbling out. Nancy was one of six female assistants who work with the act and we learn two things about her. First in a moment of drunken weakness, Scolari got seduced by her and she claims she was impregnated. Secondly she is living under an assumed name and had a secret from her past. Billy Moses who probably never thought he'd be doing such rough stuff back in law school gets to tangle with a couple of good old boys when goes seeking the truth in Grahn's home town. A little more action than usual for Ken Malansky, he almost gets himself killed.    One big flaw in this mystery is simple forensics. The medical examiner's report should have provided concrete evidence that the victim was killed in such a way that Scolari could not possibly have done the deed. The police should have been looking in a different direction for the killer.    When you see who the killer is you won't blame the individual, but you'll also see how the investigating officer James McEachin got it wrong from the start. It kind of spoils this particular Mason film."

My heart went out to him at the beginning, and somewhere along the line he went over the line. It is almost as if he is continuing this behavior to keep the show going, and at the same time is seriously risking his life, and the welfare of his family, especially his children. It is difficult even to have pity for the poor boy. I think he needs to watch this show, maybe then he might have a chance a saving this marriage. I can't understand how Gretchen stays with him, and I keep wondering how much is just for show, and how much is love. Danny, get a lifea new one that is! ... and don't get me started on Dr. Gary. What is with him and his face? His skin looks like it's stretched to the max. Besides that, looks don't mean a thing, yet he seems not to be particularly impartial. I think, he too, is keeping this going for his own monetary gain and often not in the best interests of either Gretchen or Danny. These people are few confused and each remind me of a dog chasing its tail. sad, very sad. C'mon pull yourselves together."
21898,0,"Watching Showtime I got the impression that the producers got the idea to put Robert DeNiro and Eddie Murphy just for the sake of having a film that costarred the two of them. Other than that I can't think of a reason to justify the film's existence. Not that it isn't amusing in spots, it certainly is, but the concept is so completely ludicrous that the laughs are somewhat muted. The thing that really got me was Eddie Murphy's character. I can't seem to wrap my mind around the concept of someone being a police officer as strictly a day job. When I was working person at New York State Crime Victims Board I had to deal with all kinds of cops and they ran the gamut between the really dedicated and some real slugs, but I can't think of one who thought that this was just something I do until I get my career going in an area far afield. I mean, can you really see Eddie Murphy or anyone else going through the rigors of the real Police Academy, not the screen version, just to get a day job? Anyway DeNiro is your basic hard working detective who's on the trail of a major gun dealer. He's undercover and Murphy is part of his backup. So what does the showboating Murphy do, he calls a reality based TV series like COPS to film the action.    So DeNiro's bust gets blown sky high, but the producer of the show gets some good footage of Murphy and DeNiro and decides on a new reality based television series. So these unwilling partners get joined and try to continue working DeNiro's case with all the TV cameras around. Eddie Murphy's a funny guy, I loved him in Beverly Hills Cop and in the Doctor Doolittle movies, but he's done better things than Showtime and Robert DeNiro certainly has.    I guess Murphy wanted a chance to work with DeNiro and DeNiro must have gotten one hefty paycheck to do this film."

The acting is generally pretty decent for a SciFi channel movie. Barry Corbin plays a credible US senator, and Lou Diamond Phillips again gives us a decent military/ police/ sheriff/ agent/ marshal figure. The special effects are well, "" special "" for example, the external train shots are very obviously a model train. Goofs: A meteor strikes a stationary car in the opening scene. The car bursts into flames but does not budge an inch. After the impact, the meteor is lodged in the top of the car's hoodimpossible from the low angle that the meteor came in at. Spoilers ... A good portion of the movie's events are predictable, from the helicopter crash ( "" Pull up, pull up!

The scenes showing the aliens attacking are hilarious. They are vicious cute puppets and move at lightening speedremember the Monty Python rabbit? Spoiler Goof: In one scene four people shooting clip after clip can not hit a single creature because they move at lightning speed. Later in the movie Todd Bridges rigs up a mini flame thrower which he uses to dispatch a number of creatures at close range.

22564,0,"The characterization in this movie is among the worst I've ever encountered. The dialogue is trite and clich to the point of extreme distraction. None of the issues the characters face are developed at all -- they're merely surface details intended to get a point across without having to actually come up with believable dialogue to support said point. Also, the depiction of the Chinese characters leaves a bit to be desired -- I find it hard to believe that the Chinese father learns flawless English from a book(or so it is implied in one scene) so he can teach it to his daughter. Etc. The Smile Train is a great organization and it's a nice idea, to make a heartstringtugging film about the impact a program like this can have on kids ' lives, but overall, I found this movie to be more frustrating than anything."
22743,0,"( Warning: spoilers! -- although it's hard to spoil this film by telling story details.) Eisenstein's black and white propaganda film is not for everyone. It's very old and it's, er, clumsy. What makes it great for me is the soundtrack, not the original but the updated soundtrack. Better still, the orchestral version Prokofiev created ( my favorite performance is by Fritz Reiner and the Chicago Symphony). The film is actually funny in places. It's reminiscent of the old "" Midsummer Night's Dream "". Some of the outdoor scenes are quite magnificent. Some of the actors are also quite magnificent. ( The actor who played Nevsky could have been a superstar today. Ditto for the warrior chick, Vasilisa -- definitely a rocker.)    This may be the world's best collection, on film, of pithy Russian sayings ( there are tons of them -- they make up the bulk of the spoken lines). The battle scenes actually look much more realistic than most highbudget Hollywood flix. These guys are as clumsy with their fighting as real peasants would be. The weapons look nasty, so the actors were probably trying to avoid actually wounding one another. The actor playing the German "" grand marshall "" is trying* really* hard to look scary early in the film, but he looks like he was really a pussycat. After he's captured he looks* so* pathetic. ( Speaks volumes about the intended audience, da?) A really humorous touch is that the German army brings an* organ* with it, played by a character in a black robe. Watch the Russians bring this guy down* while* he's playing. After the battle is over and almost all of the Germans are dead comes the best part of the film ( and the music), the song sung to the dead soldiers who've died defending the motherland. This part is so sad it's almost an antiwar statement. Ten times as many men as ladies have rated this film. Wonder why? Warning: Joseph Stalin liked this film. Ironic -- he killed more Russians than anybody. "" Those who come to Russia carrying a sword will die by the sword ""."
22811,0,"Focus is another great movie starring William H. Macy. I first discovered Macy in Fargo and I've seen a few of his films and he hasn't yet deceived me. Macy is the archetypal "" nice guy with something to hide "". In Focus, he plays the role of Lawrence Newman, a loyal and hardworking stiff, who harbours his handicapped mother at home. The scene is set after World War II, at the height of McCarthyism. Newman is the head of Human Resources for a company which is basically, antiSemite. After he accidentally hires a woman of Jewish descent, he is asked to buy a pair of glasses, to improve his failing eyesight. Unbelievably, the simple act of buying glasses has great repercussions on his life and that of Gertrude Hart, his wife ( played by a great Laura Dern). As the film unravels, Newman will begin to see a whole different world, where being Jewish is akin to being an animal. The movie is disturbing in the way it shows that being racist was something fairly normal. The chilling thought is that in some places, it probably still is."
23021,0,"This movie has lots of action and little heart. Let's forget for a minute that it gets just about every aspect of the Russian Revolution wrongafter all we only have only under an hour here to tell our story. In fact, the czar abdicated after World War I proved a disaster for the country, and a provisional government tried to rule as a pseudodemocracy until the Leninists took power nine months later, mainly because they promised to immediately withdraw Russia from the war. Now, back to our story. Here we have the revolution being "" rumored "" in Russian newspapers in what appears to still be a functioning country until violence erupts suddenly and upends the life of nobleman Baron Nikita ' Nikki ' Krasnoff ( Douglas Fairbanks Jr.). He flees his home with his former servant girl Tanyusha ( Nancy Carroll) in tow, and they start to make a new life in Constantinople. Before the revolution the Baron made a regular habit out of making a play for the girl, not out of any real passion, but out of boredom as a diversion of sorts. The revolution doesn't change this, and he continues to try to take advantage of what is obviously a very simple girl. It certainly doesn't make the audience like this guy to see him toying with her so. Tanyusha follows the Baron because she literally has no place to go after the revolutionaries take over the Baron's home, and she has known no other life other than waiting on Nikki hand and foot. Once in Constantinople, Nikki quickly wearies of life as a penniless laborer, and that is when he meets up with his former lover, Russian aristocrat Vera Zimina, who has a plan for getting them to Paris where the Tsarists have congregated after the revolution. Unfortunately for Tanyusha, Vera's plan does not include her. This film manages to completely waste the considerable acting talents of early talkie actress Nancy Carroll. She does a good job with what little she is given to do, but that is not much. Lilyan Tashman is the standout here, even though she has only a small role as Russian vamp Vera. Lilyan was so often given supporting roles just as she is here, but her earthy voice and glamorous looks make her the center of attention in every scene in which she appears. Guy Kibbee even shows up in a humorous bit as an American tourist who is curious about the Russian royalty that has been forcefully ejected from their homeland."

The plot is simple, the baddies have stolen a deadly virus and Guttenburg and the rest of his goodie pals are sent to retrieve it, Not bad of its kind but not in the same league ( obviously) as the films it is compared too on the cover such as AIR FORCE ONE and CON AIR.

23719,0,"This was the first directing job by Sebastian Gutierrez, the writer of Snakes on a Plane and Gothika. Anyone who has read my reviews knows that I love capers, and this was a doozy. A kidnapping and a woman shot in the process. The FBI has Emma Thompson on the kidnapping case and the Police Chief ( Roscoe Lee Browne) assigns Alan Rickman to solve the murder, which happens to be a Senator's ( Hal Holbrook) wife. These two make an outstanding pair as they work together. The kidnappers/ murderers have lovers Simon Baker ( Land of the Dead) and the ultra hot Carla Gugino ( Sin City), along with a couple of partners. They kidnapped a hotshot computer mogul and they run his accountant all over town before they get the dough. Things go fast from there as new twists and turns are brought in. The whole thing is brilliant and definitely a "" piss in your pants because you can't go to the bathroom or you'll miss something "" thrill. Now, to be completely honest, I would have given this movie a 10 if there had been more of the movie the security guard was watching in the opening. I would have loved to see more of Beverly Hotsprings and Yvette Lera, but, hey, that wasn't part of the caper; just icing on the cake. Thompson and Rickman should definitely make more movies together. One treat: Agent Hawkins: So fill me in. Detective Friedman: That remark could be misconstrued as sexual harassment, Agent Hawkins. Agent Hawkins: Let's get it out of the way then: you've never worked under a female superior before. I got to where I am by pushing paper and playing niceI've never actually fired a gun before, I'm only in this job to prove to my father I'm not a coward.

24152,0,"It wasn't until I looked at the trivia section that I found out that the original producer/ star of this movie Tyrone Power died during its making. This no doubt explains why everyone on screen seems to have their minds on other things, a symptom of which appears in a very early scene involving a battle that can only be described as pathetic. You know when you've been painting a wall until you're completely bored? Well that's the sort of expression the combatants have on their face when they're swinging their swords in a highly unconvincing manner    The plot centres on Soloman the King of Israel having an affair with the Queen of Sheeba and his people not being happy about it. You can't really blame them since there's few things more beautiful in the world than those Israeli moteks, though the Israeli women here all seem to look like Cherie Blair! Modern day Israel is also very cosmopolitan with the majority of Israelis being born outside the country but would this have been true a couple of thousand years ago where everyone speaks in European and American accents    After much talking and a dance sequence that has to be seen to be believed ( And no that's not praise) we have a climax where the heavily outnumbered Israelis have to defend themselves against a massed Egyptian army who can't read a map otherwise they would have known there was a canyon in front of them. This is what I don't getEven though their blinded by the sun the Egyptians spend ten minutes charging towards the Israelis never ever realising they're charging towards a gaping ravine! Isn't this somewhat illogical? It's also something of a revealing error since the horses, chariots and men falling into the canyon are obviously miniature figures    Anyway the film ends with Soloman killing his treacherous brother and praising God for his victory. But who needs Moshe Dayan, Arik Sharon or God when you've got an idiotic enemy who can't see a ravine in front of him or waves a sword like he paints a wall?"

Borat is complete garbage and I do not understand how it rated better then Ali G. I can not put my finger on it, there something wrong with the Ali G script: half of the jokes are as if written by a 15 years old, not by an adult scriptwriter. And a number of jokes including Mr Cohen's lower body are quite tasteless.    But the film actually comes together as a comedy and there are some valid jokes too that are funny: such as how Ali G becomes a member of government for doing something scandalous and stupid in the public ( sadly true in today's western society: people get careers for doing stupid things in public), also Ali's advice about immigrant policy and some others.    Ali G overall remains a sympathetic character, even though a kind of mentally underdeveloped for his age. But it's OK to watch, it's quite funny. But never ever watch Borat, it's awful and makes every intelligent movielover sick."

There were moments when my heart beat faster, when the hair on my neck began to stand up, when my muscles began to tighten .. but just like a strip tease, I was left with no real action, no resolution, and money missing from my wallet. Jaume Balaguer and Miguel TejadaFlores apparently don't know the correct recipe for making a Horror Movie, and as such, utilized the old amateur cook's method of throwing everything into the pot. This movie is really The Shining, Poltergeist, Amityville, and Hellraiser all rolled into one. Amazing, I know, but true. All the flavors are there, you can taste each of them, they just don't mix well. I'm not gon na go down the list of every thing wrong with this movie; in short, good cinematography, mediocre acting, worse dialogue. The -real- problem with stealing from so many movie plots and combining them into one movie, aside from the resulting confusion, is while you CAN have several plots running at one time, you can't have several endings. And what does Jaume do when he runs into this problem? Just like a Freshman in English 101, you end your story with ellipses, "" The little car vanished into the darkness and ..... THE END "" Oooh, spooky. Not really. And very anticlimactic. The ending left me confused and disappointed; almost empty. Take your$ 10, go rent The Shining, Poltergeist, and Hellraiser .. scare the pants off yourself, have a great time, and forget that The Darkness ever existed.    -BJamin"
27457,0,"It's a unique film, as it gives us our only chance to see the young Noel Coward in all his ironic glory. Because he seems so reserved & detached he's perfect for the role of an unloved cad who matteroffactly uses all those around him. However in the deadly serious ( no pun intended) last act, when Coward must make like the Flying Dutchman, he's much less comfortable. But his way with an epigram is peerless, and Hecht & Macarthur have given him some gems ( Macarthur, really -- he was the wit of the pair). The film is superbly lighted by the great Lee Garmes, but has little camera movement aside from a storm sequence. Hecht and Macarthutr cared about one thing -- getting their dialogue on screen. ( NOTE: H&M themselves have blinkandyou'llmiss-'em cameos as bums in the flophouse scene). The most notable supporting player is the one and only Alexander Woolcott, notorious Broadway columnist and close friend of both Macarthur and Coward, who appears as one of the bitchy authors always kept waiting in the reception room of publisher Coward. Curious that Woolcott would agree to do a film that clearly lampoons the legendary Algonquin Round Table, of which he was a founder, and Macarthur something of an auxiliary member. The Scoundrel actually won an Oscar for best story, though that victory is probably due more to Coward's imposing presence than any brilliance in the plot. It's Coward, Woolcott, and the dialogue you remember ..."
37891,0,"I watched this cooking show for a few times before I wanted to pull my hair out. Just one question ..... Who CAN'T cook a slapped together plain meal in 30 minutes when everything you need is at hand, already bagged, sometimes prechopped and you have very little else to do except chop a few greens. Also, almost every cooking show on TV is 30 minutes and most of these chefs do all of their prep work ( except for Sandra Lee), during their show. Oh and yep .... they do full meals too. Love the comment by the guy who hated the "" EVOO "" comment. Add "" DELISH "" to my list of stupid tag words.    Then you have the obvious .... a Loud, gregarious woman who is truly her own best audience. She laughs at her own lame comments, mugs too many times for the camera because she wants to convince us that she's as good as the thinks.    NO she ain't "" the cutest thing. "" She's a 40-something year old woman who isn't DELISH."
