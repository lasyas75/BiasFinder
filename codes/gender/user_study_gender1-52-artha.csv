3,"WHENEVER an idea was successful during those "" Golden Days "" of the Silent Movies, you could bet your bottom dollar that it would be repeated; although "" Reworking "" is the term that is used. Of course one could make the argument that this reworking business has never left us, for success in the Movies or TV always leads to a trend; with all competing parties vying to come up with their own version of said hit Movie or TV Program. TO this last premise we strongly disagree; for this is copycatting or plagiarism, plain and simple. THIS, the last Silent Laurel & Hardy Short, surely must have been quite well received; for ANGORA LOVE ( Hal Roach/ MGM, 1929) was reworked on the Roach Lot, not once, but twice over the next three years. We were treated to LAUGHING GRAVY ( Roach/ MGM, 1931), in which the Goat was replaced with a cute, little puppydog. Also, the weather is transformed into the dead of Winter, in the middle of a blizzard. They also made other lineup changes with substituting Landlord Edgar Kennedy with Landlord Charlie Hall. THE second reworking of the hidden animal premise is the 3 Reeler, THE CHIMP ( Roach/ MGM, 1932), which substituted a female ape from a dissolved and defunct Circus, to which Stan and Babe were former employees. The Circus paid off its employees with their assets and the Boys received the Chimpanzee as their final payday. BACK to our original ' victim ', today's subject, ANGORA LOVE. Recomember? THE short starts off simply enough. The boys encounter the Goat on the street and the Nanny in return follows them back to their rooming house; after Stan feeds a doughnut to her. The comic moments that follow are generated with the interplay between L & H and slowburn exponent, Edgar Kennedy, their Landlord. The incident's impact is amplified by having the interplay occur at night. And as luck would have it; their room is situated directly above the Landlord's quarters. IN addition to the noise, the bathing of the goat, its odor and Landlord Edgar's suspicions about Laurel & Hardy's having another person illegally in the room; we were most amused by a little throwaway gag, which may well have been missed by the Censors. While admonishing the boys about the noise they'd been making and reminding them of the house rules about any unauthorized person's being in there overnight, regardless of their sex. ITS camera shot is made from inside The Boy's room, over their shoulder. With Edgar in the hall and facing them, he warns; "" Remember, this is a respectable establishment! "" Just as he says this, a lady clad in evening clothes walks across and behind the Landlord; followed by a uniformed Sailor, who cocks his hat forward as they pass! POODLE SCHNITZ!!",Positive,Yes,

6,"Luc Besson's first work is also his first foray in science fiction, a genre to which he will return fourteen years later with "" the Fifth Element "" ( 1997). Even if this film was strongly influenced by Hollywood cinema, it is still highly enjoyable. Back in 1983, "" le Dernier Combat "" reveals Besson's own approach of science fiction. He takes back a threadbare topic and his efforts are discernible to make a stylish work. Shot in widescreen and black and white, a disaster has destroyed virtually all the population from earth and we will never know what was this disaster and why men can't talk any more. Some barbarian hordes were formed. In parallel, a man ( Pierre Jolivet) lives on his own and arrives in an unrecognizable Paris where he is received by a doctor ( Jean Bouise). There are no words in Besson's work. The characters ' actions and the progression of the events go through looks and gestures. Although the starting point and the backdrop are unnerving, the film has never the look of a despondent one. It seems that the man and the doctor try to reproduce gestures and actions linked to mankind before the disaster. The film opens with the man having sex with an inflatable doll. Later, the doctor tries to make him speak through a machine and he is a painter in his spare time. It's all the more intriguing as these paintings seem to come from the prehistoric times. Following this reasoning, one could argue that the bearded giant ( Jean Reno) embodies evil and a threat to the efforts deployed by the man and the doctor to regain what finally made a human being. Ditto for the gang of baddies at the beginning of the film. The pessimistic whiff that such a film could convey isn't really at the fore and gives way to a glimmer of hope. Personally, the film could have gained with no music at all, except the one the man can hear with his cassette recorder. Luc Besson was to make better and still entrancing films like this one, he also boosted Pierre Jolivet's career as a director who will leave a patchy work behind him in the future: "" Force Majeure "" ( 1989), "" Simple Mortel "" ( 1991), "" ma Petite Entreprise "" ( 1999) or "" Filles Uniques "" ( 2003).",Positive,Yes,

9,"I rarely give ratings less than 5, but in this instance I must weigh in. Elmore Leonard is a great writer with many wonderful, complex books, original characters, crisp dialogue, invigorating plot twists.

Even when done soso the films at least have some measure of story essence coming through. This one, .... it is simply not a worthy addition to the catalog. The acting is bad ( I do not know why, because these are very capable people here) and the story is handled with stupidity. The characters are rearranged, the chemistry is missing, the actors and actresses are miscast. Since Elmore Leonard is a really great story teller, I would hope that anyone who does not know his work would be dissuaded from reading his books because they saw this disappointing rendition of one of his stories. The story is a sequel to Get Shorty. If you have not seen that film, do not watch this. If you have seen Get Shorty, do not proceed to this. I saw Be Cool a few years back, and tonight have been revisiting the vid. The first time must not have made such a negative impression because I had forgotten how dismal this sequel was. Fortunately, I think no less of those who appeared in this film for having done so. They probably expected something more. Get Shorty was original and great fun. Travolta I nearly always like, but he is so much better in Tarantino's Pulp Fiction and in the preceding Get Shorty. He was clearly unable to enjoy whatever was going on here.

27,"I absolutely love standup comedy. I love to hear the raw thoughts of the standup on stage, as they are appealing to an audience of their peers different life experiences they have had, or things they have thought up or seen that they just thought were so**** ing stupid that they had to share it with someone.    There used to be standups who took on a persona that everyone could relate to ( Rodney Dangerfield comes to mind) or were just so damn crazy that you couldn't help but laugh with them as they laughed at others ( Richard Pryor). And then, there were the thoughtprovoking comics like George Carlin, who, despite pretending to be a loon, was the smartest guy in the room, who appealed to people to rethink things they saw when they walked around, and realize just how screwed up things were, and how easily they could change things. Now, this might seem to not have anything to do with "" Mind Of Mencia, "" which, as I agree with most commentators here, is Comedy Central's horrid solution to the loss of "" Chappelle's Show, "" but it does. Carlos Mencia spends half of the show doing standup bits for his audience, sometimes on popular topics, most of the time on just racism and racial stereotypes. He tries to be all three of the above types of standups. He makes a stage character, an everyday Mexican named Carlos who, despite stereotypes, is just your runofthemill normal guy. He then proceeds to try to laugh at others, people he calls racist or just those that disagree with his opinion. And then, finally, he presents skits to the studio audience and the viewer, telling them that it will help them see his point of view. Carlos Mencia always says he's showing a point of view that people don't see, yet what he is really doing is not only promoting racist stereotypes that already exist and have been joked about to death, but he stupidly encourages people to hear them and do the one thing that helps keep them around: laugh. Promoting stereotypes is usually the lowest, yet easiest, way to get laughs in standup. The best comedians, which, I fear, Carlos Mencia feels he is in good company with, don't have to resort to them. They talk universally, and ask you to laugh AT absurdity, rather than with it, like Mencia encourages. As he creates more skits or "" reallife "" situations that call for racism or the bashing of others with the use of it, he tells us, rather than asks us, to laugh, and actually presents these absurdities as truth, rather than just extremes of it.    His show is an insult to the minds of those who watch it. Mencia doesn't give us comedy and ask us to digest it and take from it what we want ( something that, as much as I hate to compare the two, was "" Chappelle's Show's "" finest quality) he tells us exactly how we should view it and react to it --- which, according to him, is to make a stupid face and say "" Dee Dee Dee! "" This show is appropriately named. It is indeed a show about "" The Mind of Mencia. "" It's Mencia's mind, through and through, and, as such, is nothing more than dumb entertainment.

42,"Luc Besson's first work is also his first foray in science fiction, a genre to which he will return fourteen years later with "" the Fifth Element "" ( 1997). Even if this film was strongly influenced by Hollywood cinema, it is still highly enjoyable. Back in 1983, "" le Dernier Combat "" reveals Besson's own approach of science fiction. He takes back a threadbare topic and his efforts are discernible to make a stylish work. Shot in widescreen and black and white, a disaster has destroyed virtually all the population from earth and we will never know what was this disaster and why men can't talk any more. Some barbarian hordes were formed. In parallel, a man ( Pierre Jolivet) lives on his own and arrives in an unrecognizable Paris where he is received by a doctor ( Jean Bouise). There are no words in Besson's work. The characters ' actions and the progression of the events go through looks and gestures. Although the starting point and the backdrop are unnerving, the film has never the look of a despondent one. It seems that the man and the doctor try to reproduce gestures and actions linked to mankind before the disaster. The film opens with the man having sex with an inflatable doll. Later, the doctor tries to make him speak through a machine and he is a painter in his spare time. It's all the more intriguing as these paintings seem to come from the prehistoric times. Following this reasoning, one could argue that the bearded giant ( Jean Reno) embodies evil and a threat to the efforts deployed by the man and the doctor to regain what finally made a human being. Ditto for the gang of baddies at the beginning of the film. The pessimistic whiff that such a film could convey isn't really at the fore and gives way to a glimmer of hope. Personally, the film could have gained with no music at all, except the one the man can hear with his cassette recorder. Luc Besson was to make better and still entrancing films like this one, he also boosted Pierre Jolivet's career as a director who will leave a patchy work behind him in the future: "" Force Majeure "" ( 1989), "" Simple Mortel "" ( 1991), "" ma Petite Entreprise "" ( 1999) or "" Filles Uniques "" ( 2003).",Positive,Yes,
