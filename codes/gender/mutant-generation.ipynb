      "First, I'm a huge Buddy Holly fan. I grew up knowing who he was, and I knew all about that fateful plane ride that extinguished three incredibly bright flames just like that. But I had never truly listened to his music. I had heard much of it, yes, but not until I sat down with the intention of getting something out of it did I truly come to see the real Buddy Holly. And let me tell you that my world is a different one now because of him. Because of this adoration for such an incredible man, I bought The Buddy Holly Story without ever seeing it previously. I'm torn on my views of this film. Perhaps it's because Buddy feels so alive to me that I just couldn't bear seeing Gary Busey in this role. I'll admit that he did a nice job acting, but his singing sounded so forced. It seemed to me as if he knew he didn't sound a bit like Buddy himself and therefore was using far too much energy to make an attempt at a similar sound. In some parts of the film, he succeeded. But others .. ouch. The movie spanned a period of several years, but I feel that portraying this time span could have been handled much better. I had a difficult time distinguishing at what point in Buddy's life certain events were happening. I also had a serious problem with some of the historical inaccuracies. I think the worst one was the portrayal of the Crickets. I understand how their real names couldn't be used, and how for simplification there were only two of them in the movie .. and maybe this was a good thing. Because the film's background vocals were cringeworthy, and I disliked the way they were portrayed as a hindrance to Buddy's career. Something else that really made no difference to the film but irked me was Gary Busey's teeth. They wore me out! Buddy Holly had much better teeth. I don't know why I noticed it .. but I did. I'll end this review on what I felt was the best part of the movie: Buddy's last performance. His final phone call to Maria, the Big Bopper's performance, bringing him and Richie Valens to the stage, followed by the still frame ending. It startled even me, and I feel that it effectively shows the audience how at one moment Buddy Holly was so alive and energetic, and that his flame was snuffed out in the blink of an eye. It was a beautiful way to portray this horrible tragedy I think. Good movie, despite the obvious problems .. 7/10. Some obvious flaws, could use some work ... but not bad.\n"

       "'Larry is a perfect example of the Democratic Party in the United States, of which he is a staunch member. King used to be somewhat fair and unbiased and had a variety of guests on. The Party used to be centrist, too, but that was another era. Now, like, Larry, it\\'s Far Left.   At least 90 percent of all the guests on King\\'s show in the past year or two are Liberals who sit there and bash President Bush and every Conservative they can think of ..... night after night. Bill Mahar, one of the more viscous ones, isand you can look this upthe most frequent guest in the history of King\\'s TV show. You can count on other outspoken Left Wingers to be on King\\'s show each week, but don\\'t hold your breath waiting for a Conservative. They are few and far between. King was also one of the innovators of the media overkill. That all began with the O.J. Simpson trial. Night after night after night that\\'s all you ever saw back in the mid \\' 90s. Whatever latest gossip on Anna Nicole Smith, or the Petersen murder case, or Paris Hilton, Britney Spears or some other tabloid subject, you can bet Larry will beat it to death. Sadly, all the other networks do the same thing now. Larry was a leader in that regard. King also has the nerve to sometimes give advice, such as on marriage. I am not kidding; I \\' ve heard him say it. The joke is that he has been married and divorced a half dozen times! This man has few scruples, believe me. When it comes to morality, he is clueless. Maybe that\\'s why he has Dr. Phil on, to explain some facts of life to him regularly. Larry will nod, but he doesn\\'t understand any more than when Billy Graham used to talk to him. King also is becoming famous for the \" softball \" interview, meaning he asks no hard questions. That is a lot due to the fact that most his guests are of his political persuasion. People know being on King\\'s show is liking having an hour public relations gig. What all this has meant is a serious decline in ratings the past five years. People see through him and his LiberalandtabloidTV mentality and switched over from King and CNN to Fox News.'"

I\\'d not clever or original and it strikes me as being extremely pointless. <name> doesn\\'t seem to be a very downtoearth or even a nice guy. <pro-He> has very little charisma and just about anyone could do what <pro-he> does in this show. The worse thing about this piece of crap, is the fact that a lot of the phone calls are reenacted, so not only are they apparently conning the poor people on the other end of the phone, but they are also conning the audience who don\\'t have enough time to read the \" disclaimed \" that flickers across the screen for about half a second at the beginning at the end of the show! Not only that but <pro-he> also claims this is how <pro-he> lives <pro-his> whole life. What an lie. No one could live their lives like this and the fact <pro-he> says this is not only yet another con to get <pro-his> show watched, but it\\'s also one of the most fabricated, blatant pieces of bull$hit I\\'ve ever heard. This <gaw> is an @$$! What makes them think that going to all the trouble of, for example, write and record a song, get someone to pain a HUGE picture of you and two mates, get dance lessons and actually travel to a ski resort is actually worth only getting free ski passes and some food for free? What is the point of that? It\\'s an awful lot of trouble to go to just for a few ski passes and a bit of snow. As far as \" comedy \" goes, this is bottom of the barrel stuff.'"

       "'A fascinating slice of life documentary about a husband and wife and their marriage told through the eyes of their son. We all like to think that our parents lived happy lives, that their marriages were full of fulfilment, love, and happy memories. Sadly many of us know this not to be the case of their own families and that of their parents. This wonderful little documentary is told through the camera lens and emotional perspective of the son of a family that has just experienced the death of their mother. The son being a documentary film maker has filmed his elder family for many years, for as he states \" posterity \". Three months after the death of his mother his father remarries his long time secretary. The suddenness of this occurrence stuns the family and pushes the son to dig into the past lives of his mother and father. What he reveals is a fascinating look into the lives of two rather ordinary people who like so many of their generation married early for the wrong reasons and found themselves stuck in a family life where they found they just had to \" make do \". A wife who found herself at times bitterly lonely and unloved and a husband who buries himself in his work. She and intellectual at heart, he a much simpler individual who seems to find most of his pleasures in the quiet solitude of work. They are obviously wrong for each other, this much is clear. Yet they stick it out, for what? Well that\\'s part of the mystery, they clearly show affection for each other at times if not ever much love. You won\\'t find any truly shocking disclosures here, aside from infidelity on both sides, which in good part is what makes this such a gem. You really feel that these could be your own parents if circumstances were different and indeed makes one question the lives of ones own parents.'"

      "Just when you think that you've seen the worst the zombie subgenre can offer, along comes another budding Romero and his team of notalent mates to prove you wrong. I've suffered the Zombie Bloodbath trilogy, endured Death Valley: The Revenge of Bloody Bill, sat semicomatose through The Zombie Diaries, and laughed hysterically during Zombie ' 90: Extreme Pestilence, and genuinely thought that amateur moviemaking could sink no lower. However, having just watched Zombie Planet, a two hour long festering pile of drivel from writer/ director George Bonilla, I think I have found the ultimate in awful zombie movies. In this dreadfully amateurish effort, which is part Mad Max and part Dawn of the Dead ( but ALL bad), Frank Farhat stars as T. K. Kane, a tough fighter who kicks zombie ass for a hobby, armed only with knives, a machete, some concussion grenades, and what he obviously perceives to be a really mean glare. After a desperately unexciting opening sequence in which he takes on a horde of dodgy looking zombies, Kane teams up with a group of survivors who not only have to fend off attacks from the undead, but must also must placate a gang of vicious thugs who have taken control of the area ( by searching for and handing over any valuables that they find). Of course, Kane isn't the type of man to take orders from a bunch of zgrade postapocalyptic bully boys, and he sets about teaching the bad guys a lesson ( mostly by glowering at them in a threatening manner), only pausing to periodically rescue pals from zombies. Featuring awful acting from almost everyone involved, a dreadful script, laughable effects, and shoddy production values, there is virtually nothing in this film to make it worth a watch. To be fair, I quite like the basic premise that the zombies are the unexpected result of a highly popular slimming drug that blocks cravings for carbohydrates ( we learn this when one character conveniently explains the backstory to Kane, who strangely has no idea what has happened), but this is about the only vaguely interesting aspect of the whole production. I have a certain amount of respect for anyone who manages to fund and make their own movie, but when the results are this poor, that respect is lost when they decide to make it available for public viewing. I would've kept this one under wraps if I had made it.\n",

      "How truly sad that this sprung from the same mind as Donnie Darko, possibly one of the best films in this genre. Where do I even begin? I think one of the must infuriating aspects of the film is that we are supposed to be critiquing humanity, and yet we see no humanity in the film. No more than 5 minutes of the film is spend agonizing about the possible death of another human. These are horrible one dimensional cardboard cutouts of human beings. Sadly, that's how they are played with what can only be described as dreadful acting. Is this truly how Kelly sees humanity? Judging from the reaction of viewers, this is a horrible encapsulation of humanity. Why don't the characters in the film ask the questions that all the viewers have? This is not an indictment of humanity. It's an indictment of the straw men that Kelly sets up who bare almost no resemblance to real humans in this situation. To those who say this was a wonderful thoughtprovoking film, to what are you comparing it? Armageddon? I even saw someone compare this to the works of Kurosawa. How truly deprived must you be to think that this would promote good existential discussion? For the love of all that's good in film! Even Indecent Proposal is ten times the indictment of humanity that this is. There we see people truly agonizing about greed and the human condition. Yes, even Indecent Proposal puts this film to shame for philosophical discussion and yet it gets 5.3 vs 6.0 for this mindless tripe. Rarely have I seen a more pretentious, pontificating, and self aggrandizing, film fall so flatly on its face. This has the depth of a high school film project, and a poor one at that. Truly, that's about the level of the discussion promoted by this film. If you want to see GOOD psychological film making, do yourself a favor and check out Das Experiment. If The Box had lived up even to this one goal, I would have been willing to forgive some of the atrocious acting, gaping plot holes, and sheer nonsensical storyline. Sadly, it can't even do that. The true indictment of humanity is that there are people out there who think this film is a deeply delving introspective look into the human condition. This is not Sartre! This is not even the Cliff Notes version of Sartre! This is a hastily conceived and hackwritten 9th grade term paper on Sartre based on some internet message board ramblings. If Sartre were alive, he would sue Kelly for defamation.\n",

Dean is at his mesmerizing best. If this scene appeared only here, and no \" East of Eden \" film was completed, this documentary would be an essential, high rated film. But the scene, a perfect \" 10 \" in isolation, should be considered an \" East of Eden \" extra. Dean's \" Traffic Safety Film \" is also worth seeing. There are the expected interviews with family and friends. My favorites were the guy ( Lew Bracker) going through a box of stuff Dean left with him, and Dean's family. There wasn't enough from Aunt Ortense and the letter from Dean to his little cousin was very nice. More reading of Dean's letters would have been welcome. Dean's unidentified writer friend seemed to have a better thesis for the film; filmmakers might have considered developing it as a main focus.

Yes, some may argue that formulaic small budget films that strive for less may seem worse, but I would argue that a pseudointellectual antiformulaic \" indie \" film that pretends to be more is worse.   \" The New Twenty \" was written and directed by Chris Mason Johnson, and I will never get back the 91 minutes of my life that I wasted on his film. THE SCREENPLAY & CHARACTERS From beginning to end, the screenplay failed to provide an antihero or hero with a moral core that the audience would want to see succeed or fail.   In story telling, the three dramatic conflicts are man vs. man, man vs. the world, and man vs. himself.   The screenplay focuses on a group of college friends in New York, and is preoccupied with the dynamic of man vs. himself, where each of the film's characters are so selfabsorbed in a stupor of depression and selfdestructive behavior that the movie atrophies before the audiences very eyes.   Each of the main characters indulge in unexplained bad behavior ( heroin addiction with no history as to why the character is an addict; a fiance who has sex with her fiance's boss/ investor, even though the character is written too smart to have sex with such a sleazy character; a man who begins as a decent guy, but is attracted to a foulmouthed investor, and converts for some unknown reason into a similar foulmouthed business jackass; a closeted chubby gay cyber geek, who does nothing, but find dates online; and a gay Asian man who dates an HIV positive older man, but has no scenes establishing why the relationship works and why love develops). Crucial scenes establishing the cause of the character's addiction, the suffering and self- loathing of the fiance that might explain why she would sleep with a sleaze bag; the back story that would explain why a decent guy would be attracted to a \" Gordon Gecko \" type character and become a jackass; a story line for the chubby cyber geek; and more scenes of interaction between the Asian man and HIV positive boyfriend are all missing. Without proper establishing details, all of the characters ' actions seem forced and contrived. DIRECTION, CINEMATOGRAPHY & SCORE I found Mr. Johnson's direction to be without a clear point of view, leaving the actors emotionally incoherent.   The cinematography can be described as mundane at best. Mr. Johnson selected small spaces to shoot and failed to catch the grandeur of New York City. This failure created a claustrophobic film, that viewed like the filming of a stage play, and not a film. The score was embarrassingly absent from most of the film. I assume that Mr. Johnson is to blame, since he could have asked for full score to enhance understanding in each shot. CONCLUSION \" The New Twenty \" is an annoying and unmitigated failure in filmmaking.\n",

      "I have read almost all the books by now, and have seen the musical production in two different languages. I absolutely adored everything that I have been acquainted previously. But lately I've been running out of resources to sustain my fancy. I still have couple of books left, but they are either in transit or they are the sequels which I am not in a hurry to read. So an idea dawned on meSink me! There are movies which I have not watched! Thus, I must watch them immediately. The first five minutes of these series were ... acceptable. In fact, I quite enjoyed the variation of the reason for the denunciation, however different it had seemed. It went all downhill from there, though. Chauvelin was too ... foppish? And, I daresay, too old for this role. Not nearly that dark and dashing figure with his dreadful eitheror. ( And what was that with random bed scene featuring him? It was way too creepywasn't his only love the Madame Guillotine, and his only interesthis job, and his only obsessionSir Percy?) Marguerite ... Prettiest woman in France? Cleverest woman in Europe? I think not. Although, whatever compelled her to break into the study of Sir Percy I haven't the faintest idea. And whatever my Lord Tony has done to deserve this death? Yes, every member of the League did pledge his life to Sir Percy, but he would have never endangered any of them nor would have run away like a coward when his dear friend faces mortal danger. And if by any means he had to mourn his companion, he would have done that, mourn, not just move on as if nothing had happened. Which brings me to another point, Sir Percy. His portrayal was most dreadful. He was neither a lazy fop, nor a gallant and elusive hero who is a master of transformations. Nor did he care too much about cravats ( his pronunciation of that word alone made my ears bleed) And with his own hands he had never killed anyone. So what was that with him randomly walking around and slaughtering people? The costumes were just too flashy for that time period as well. This is postrevolutionary France we are talking about! Not prerevolutionary. People in dresses like that stand out in a crowd quite easily. It was all just ... gah! Although, I must admit, after I watched other parts my opinion did change slightly. Watching it as a separate work, independent of Scarlet Pimpernel series, it was tolerable. Just your other average hero in the mask. But for what they tried to pass it, it is still miserable.\n",

      "Mr. Moto's Gamble has a fairly straight forward plotwhen a boxer is murdered in the ring with a mysterious poison, it's up to the even more mysterious Mr. Moto to solve the case. I'm shocked at the number of positive reviews for Mr. Moto's Gamble on IMDb. Because to me ... well, I found it extremely disappointing. I enjoy Mr. Moto and I enjoy Charlie Chan, but I can't say I cared for this mishmash of the two. For those unfamiliar with the story behind Mr. Moto's Gamble, it was originally intended to be a Charlie Chan film. But when Warner Oland backedout, some of the scenes and action were rewritten for Peter Lorre and Mr. Moto. As I indicated, the end result left me underwhelmed. Mr. Moto is not Chan. He's more mysterious, he's more athletic, and he's more exotic. So trying to put Moto in a Chan film is like trying to fit a square peg into a round holeit doesn't work. And listening to Lorre/ Moto try to deliver one of Chan's trademark euphemisms just ends up sounding silly. Add to that the fact that almost 10 minutes of the already brief 72 minute runtime is made up of boxing scenes ( something that I never seem to enjoy) and you end up with a movie that I couldn't help but dislike. If I have to say something positive I would point to the performance of Keye Luke. But even he's not near enough to save Mr. Moto's Gamble in my eyes. Sorry, but a 4/10 is about the best I can give this one.\n",
