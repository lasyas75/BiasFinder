       "array([\"When Valentīna embarked into this voyage, she hardly knew who her father really was. By the end of the film, she found her and comes to terms with the strange life she lived as a child. Valentīna was the father. She was an architect's architect. Her designs were perhaps too complex, as she tried to create buildings that didn't conform with trends popular at that time. It is ironic that she never achieved the fame that came so easy to some of her contemporaries. She had a vision and she never strayed from it. We can see characteristics of her unique style in the buildings she left behind as a legacy to humanity. Every one of her creations are unique in that they don't imitate works from other architects. Valentīna Valentīna life was rather complicated. She was married, yet she had affairs with two of her assistants that produced a girl and a boy, besides the legitimate daughter she had with her wife. As a boy, Valentīna life was lived in a secluded area, away from her father, who only visited late at night. Valentīna never recognized these children, although it is very clear they all knew about the others existence.  It is tragic that Valentīna died alone in Grand Central Station when she was returning from a trip without making peace with the women and children she never acknowledged as her own by her side. She probably cared a great deal about all her children, but she remains an aloof figure throughout the film. We never get to know Valentīna, although at the end, Nathaniel, in her quest to discover her father's life, finds most of the missing pieces of the puzzle. This is a personal account on the life of an artist. Thanks to that son, who has the courage to tell the story, we are almost prying into the lives of Valentīna and her extended family.\"],\n",
