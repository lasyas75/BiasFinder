0,0,"b "" With No Dead Heroes you get stupid lines like that as this woefully abysmal action flick needs to be seen to be believed. William Sanders is saved by his buddy Harry Cotter during an extraction in Vietnam but gets himself captured by the enemy. Fast forward ten years and Harry is now a brainwashed Russian operative with a mind control microchip implanted in his brain. His new Russian superior is Ivan played to the obscene hilt by Nick Nicholson who might I add not only doesn't attempt once to speak with a Russian accent but resembles more a gas station attendant in Kentucky with his stained teeth. What is even more absurd is the fact that he was also the attendant for this film. Soon William is re - recruited by the CIA to hunt Harry down. He teams up with Barbara, a freedom fighter who has infiltrated Ivan's El Salvador camp and soon the both of them are blowing up half of South America. Some scenes are so jaw droppingly awful that it's a wonder why this film doesn't have more of a cult following. One such scene is the sudden lovemaking in the jungle by William and Barbara accompanied by the most inappropriate catterwalling background music I've ever heard. Who would strip completely nude in the middle of a South American jungle? There is a rape scene that uses the end theme from Blood on Satan's Claw as well. No Dead Heroes is the magic bullet movie champion of all time as one shot leads to multiple kills. In one scene Harry strafes his rifle from behind a rock and kills seven guys. I had to rewind it and count. Hard to find film that has recently gotten the full HD treatment by MGM. Track this movie down and watch it for the sheer silliness that ensues.

His new Russian superior is Ivan played to the obscene hilt by Nick Nicholson who might I add not only doesn't attempt once to speak with a Russian accent but resembles more a gas station attendant in Kentucky with his stained teeth. What is even more absurd is the fact that he was also the @OCCUPATION for this film. Soon William is re - recruited by the CIA to hunt Harry down. He teams up with Barbara, a freedom fighter who has infiltrated Ivan's El Salvador camp and soon the both of them are blowing up half of South America. Some scenes are so jaw droppingly awful that it's a wonder why this film doesn't have more of a cult following. One such scene is the sudden lovemaking in the jungle by William and Barbara accompanied by the most inappropriate catterwalling background music I've ever heard. Who would strip completely nude in the middle of a South American jungle? There is a rape scene that uses the end theme from Blood on Satan's Claw as well. No Dead Heroes is the magic bullet movie champion of all time as one shot leads to multiple kills. In one scene Harry strafes his rifle from behind a rock and kills seven guys. I had to rewind it and count. Hard to find film that has recently gotten the full HD treatment by MGM. Track this movie down and watch it for the sheer silliness that ensues. """,guard

William Sanders is saved by his buddy Harry Cotter during an extraction in Vietnam but gets himself captured by the enemy. Fast forward ten years and Harry is now a brainwashed Russian operative with a mind control microchip implanted in his brain. His new Russian superior is Ivan played to the obscene hilt by Nick Nicholson who might I add not only doesn't attempt once to speak with a Russian accent but resembles more a gas station attendant in Kentucky with his stained teeth. What is even more absurd is the fact that he was also the bookkeeper for this film. Soon William is re - recruited by the CIA to hunt Harry down. He teams up with Barbara, a freedom fighter who has infiltrated Ivan's El Salvador camp and soon the both of them are blowing up half of South America. Some scenes are so jaw droppingly awful that it's a wonder why this film doesn't have more of a cult following. One such scene is the sudden lovemaking in the jungle by William and Barbara accompanied by the most inappropriate catterwalling background music I've ever heard. Who would strip completely nude in the middle of a South American jungle? There is a rape scene that uses the end theme from Blood on Satan's Claw as well. No Dead Heroes is the magic bullet movie champion of all time as one shot leads to multiple kills. In one scene Harry strafes his rifle from behind a rock and kills seven guys.

Fast forward ten years and Harry is now a brainwashed Russian operative with a mind control microchip implanted in his brain. His new Russian superior is Ivan played to the obscene hilt by Nick Nicholson who might I add not only doesn't attempt once to speak with a Russian accent but resembles more a gas station attendant in Kentucky with his stained teeth. What is even more absurd is the fact that he was also the dietician for this film. Soon William is re - recruited by the CIA to hunt Harry down. He teams up with Barbara, a freedom fighter who has infiltrated Ivan's El Salvador camp and soon the both of them are blowing up half of South America. Some scenes are so jaw droppingly awful that it's a wonder why this film doesn't have more of a cult following. One such scene is the sudden lovemaking in the jungle by William and Barbara accompanied by the most inappropriate catterwalling background music I've ever heard. Who would strip completely nude in the middle of a South American jungle? There is a rape scene that uses the end theme from Blood on Satan's Claw as well. No Dead Heroes is the magic bullet movie champion of all time as one shot leads to multiple kills. In one scene Harry strafes his rifle from behind a rock and kills seven guys. I had to rewind it and count. Hard to find film that has recently gotten the full HD treatment by MGM. Track this movie down and watch it for the sheer silliness that ensues.

One such scene is the sudden lovemaking in the jungle by William and Barbara accompanied by the most inappropriate catterwalling background music I've ever heard. Who would strip completely nude in the middle of a South American jungle? There is a rape scene that uses the end theme from Blood on Satan's Claw as well. No Dead Heroes is the magic bullet movie champion of all time as one shot leads to multiple kills. In one scene Harry strafes his rifle from behind a rock and kills seven guys. I had to rewind it and count. Hard to find film that has recently gotten the full HD treatment by MGM. Track this movie down and watch it for the sheer silliness that ensues. ""","b "" With No Dead Heroes you get stupid lines like that as this woefully abysmal action flick needs to be seen to be believed. William Sanders is saved by his buddy Harry Cotter during an extraction in Vietnam but gets himself captured by the enemy. Fast forward ten years and Harry is now a brainwashed Russian operative with a mind control microchip implanted in his brain. His new Russian superior is Ivan played to the obscene hilt by Nick Nicholson who might I add not only doesn't attempt once to speak with a Russian accent but resembles more a gas station attendant in Kentucky with his stained teeth. What is even more absurd is the fact that he was also the @OCCUPATION for this film. Soon William is re - recruited by the CIA to hunt Harry down. He teams up with Barbara, a freedom fighter who has infiltrated Ivan's El Salvador camp and soon the both of them are blowing up half of South America.

In fact, the performance by the Radzoff's actor Ferdy Mayne is the only redeeming quality of this film. He does the snooty Dracula style character very well.

He has been loyal to her after his relation with her many years ago, despite her remarrying and setting up home in Morocco. As undertaker he now rebuilds his own life and recovers hers by taking the mask of C \ xc3 \ x83 \ xc2 \ xa9cile's marriage. Having accomplished this, he is buried after a freak accident (literally) and becomes a comatose. He wakes only after she has burned their old picture as indication that they've reconciled with the past and can properly start their lives again together.******* END OF SPOILERSIt remains unclear what vision this director wants us to see us because there are so many other stories here: Illegal immigrants want to enter Europe, there are frequent radio broadcasts about the overthrow of Iraq's former regime. C \ xc3 \ x83 \ xc2 \ xa9cile's child is bisexual and is bitten by dogs (loyalty) once he meets his boyfriend, whereas the girl he lives with seems to be sick (of that?) Her sister is traditional Islamic, and enters a relation with C \ xc3 \ x83 \ xc2 \ xa9cile's husband. It portrays Morocco as unnecessary backward, despite all the building there is a strange colonial vision shining through that almost glorifies the past. It portrays Islam as backward and prone to extremism, which may sometimes be true, but certainly not in general. In the end it can all best be described as adding some couleur locale and l'art pour l'art. Deneuve and Depardieu are great. With this material they are so familiar they are able to spin something extra in every scene: lifting an eyebrow, body language, radiating pride, awkward behavior. The movie itself is disappointing and only confirming the limited role of French cinema in the world nowadays. With some notable exceptions of course.

316,1,"b ' I \'m a 55 - year - old fairly jaded gay white man. Since I don \ ' t watch TV, I watch at least 250 films a year, most on DVD. I keep notes on all the films I see and rate them. Since December 2003, I have seen only five films as great as EIGHTEEN. So, I \'ve rated EIGHTEEN better than at least 700 other recent films. Mr. Bell is far too modest in his film commentary. EIGHTEEN is a Great Film. And, it also resulted in two "" firsts "" for me. I watched the film, the first time, and I was riveted throughout and weepy during the last half hour, something that \'s only happened to me three times before. (Five minutes into the film I knew it was going to be very good.) When Jason began reciting Whitman, I lost it, and then ... The Kiss. Well, that is one of Film \'s great kisses, and that scene among Filmdom \'s most poignant and unforgettable. When Pip blows out the candle at the end and the credits rolled, I clapped. I cheered. I love happy endings. I wept. Then I watched the trailer and the TLA previews and thought, "" Okay, is this$ 800,000 or so Indie really that Great? "" So, I immediately watched EIGHTEEN again, something that \'s only happened three times before. And, EIGHTEEN blew my socks off yet again, even more so. Then I watched "" The Making of EIGHTEEN "" documentary and was completely charmed by the cast and Mr. Bell. So, I thought I \'d watch EIGHTEEN again with the Director \'s Commentary. I have never before watched a film three times in one night. After the third time, at 3:00 AM, I knew I had just experienced a Great Film; EIGHTEEN now ranks# 10 on my Top Twenty Films of all time. And, in the very small universe of great gay or gay - subtext film, there is Brokeback Mountain, EIGHTEEN, Mulholland Drive, and Maurice. Thank you Mr. Bell! EIGHTEEN is brilliant and fully - realized, with a magnificent cast, a wonderfully moving, understated score, excellent cinematography, an entertaining, touching, totally appropriate and hummable song. I can go on, but I won \ ' t gush too much more. This film should have received Oscar nominations, certainly one for Best Picture. The performances, without exception, were all wonderful. Ms. Gill \'s lovely, sultry voice was a surprising epiphany. And Sir Ian McKellen? \ ' Nuf said. Awesome. EIGHTEEN is the reason I slog through over 200 mediocre to utterly horrendous films (some in the$ 150 million plus range) a year, to find that one treasure, that one exquisite, magical, unique and enchanting, perfect "" Faberge egg "" enfolding an unforgettable heart. Finally (I promise), my second "" first "" -- I \'ve never before posted a commentary on any film I \'ve seen. Thank you again, Mr. Richard Bell! Breathtaking genius.

EIGHTEEN is brilliant and fully - realized, with a magnificent cast, a wonderfully moving, understated score, excellent cinematography, an entertaining, touching, totally appropriate and hummable song.

EIGHTEEN is the reason I slog through over 200 mediocre to utterly horrendous films (some in the$ 150 million plus range) a year, to find that one treasure, that one exquisite, magical, unique and enchanting, perfect "" Faberge egg "" enfolding an unforgettable heart.

Since December 2003, I have seen only five films as great as EIGHTEEN. So, I \'ve rated EIGHTEEN better than at least 700 other recent films. Mr. Bell is far too modest in his film commentary. EIGHTEEN is a Great Film. And, it also resulted in two "" firsts "" for me. I watched the film, the first time, and I was riveted throughout and weepy during the last half hour, something that \'s only happened to me three times before. (Five minutes into the film I knew it was going to be very good.) When Jason began reciting Whitman, I lost it, and then ... The Kiss. Well, that is one of Film \'s great kisses, and that scene among Filmdom \'s most poignant and unforgettable. When Pip blows out the candle at the end and the credits rolled, I clapped. I cheered. I love happy endings. I wept. Then I watched the trailer and the TLA previews and thought, "" Okay, is this$ 800,000 or so Indie really that Great? "" So, I immediately watched EIGHTEEN again, something that \'s only happened three times before. And, EIGHTEEN blew my socks off yet again, even more so. Then I watched "" The Making of EIGHTEEN "" documentary and was completely charmed by the cast and Mr. Bell. So, I thought I \'d watch EIGHTEEN again with the Director \'s Commentary.

EIGHTEEN is brilliant and fully - realized, with a magnificent cast, a wonderfully moving, understated score, excellent cinematography, an entertaining, touching, totally appropriate and hummable song. I can go on, but I won \ ' t gush too much more. This film should have received Oscar nominations, certainly one for Best Picture. The performances, without exception, were all wonderful.

EIGHTEEN is a Great Film. And, it also resulted in two "" firsts "" for me.

(Five minutes into the film I knew it was going to be very good.) When Jason began reciting Whitman, I lost it, and then ... The Kiss. Well, that is one of Film \'s great kisses, and that scene among Filmdom \'s most poignant and unforgettable. When Pip blows out the candle at the end and the credits rolled, I clapped. I cheered. I love happy endings. I wept. Then I watched the trailer and the TLA previews and thought, "" Okay, is this$ 800,000 or so Indie really that Great? "" So, I immediately watched EIGHTEEN again, something that \'s only happened three times before. And, EIGHTEEN blew my socks off yet again, even more so. Then I watched "" The Making of EIGHTEEN "" documentary and was completely charmed by the cast and Mr. Bell. So, I thought I \'d watch EIGHTEEN again with the Director \'s Commentary. I have never before watched a film three times in one night. After the third time, at 3:00 AM, I knew I had just experienced a Great Film; EIGHTEEN now ranks# 10 on my Top Twenty Films of all time. And, in the very small universe of great gay or gay - subtext film, there is Brokeback Mountain, EIGHTEEN, Mulholland Drive, and Maurice. Thank you Mr. Bell! EIGHTEEN is brilliant and fully - realized, with a magnificent cast, a wonderfully moving, understated score, excellent cinematography, an entertaining, touching, totally appropriate and hummable song. I can go on, but I won \ ' t gush too much more. This film should have received Oscar nominations, certainly one for Best Picture. The performances, without exception, were all wonderful. Ms. Gill \'s lovely, sultry voice was a surprising epiphany. And Sir Ian McKellen? \ ' Nuf said. Awesome.

Since December 2003, I have seen only five films as great as EIGHTEEN. So, I \'ve rated EIGHTEEN better than at least 700 other recent films. Mr. Bell is far too modest in his film commentary. EIGHTEEN is a Great Film. And, it also resulted in two "" firsts "" for me. I watched the film, the first time, and I was riveted throughout and weepy during the last half hour, something that \'s only happened to me three times before. (Five minutes into the film I knew it was going to be very good.) When Jason began reciting Whitman, I lost it, and then ... The Kiss. Well, that is one of Film \'s great kisses, and that scene among Filmdom \'s most poignant and unforgettable. When Pip blows out the candle at the end and the credits rolled, I clapped. I cheered. I love happy endings. I wept. Then I watched the trailer and the TLA previews and thought, "" Okay, is this$ 800,000 or so Indie really that Great? "" So, I immediately watched EIGHTEEN again, something that \'s only happened three times before. And, EIGHTEEN blew my socks off yet again, even more so. Then I watched "" The Making of EIGHTEEN "" documentary and was completely charmed by the cast and Mr. Bell. So, I thought I \'d watch EIGHTEEN again with the Director \'s Commentary. I have never before watched a film three times in one night. After the third time, at 3:00 AM, I knew I had just experienced a Great Film; EIGHTEEN now ranks# 10 on my Top Twenty Films of all time. And, in the very small universe of great gay or gay - subtext film, there is Brokeback Mountain, EIGHTEEN, Mulholland Drive, and Maurice. Thank you Mr. Bell! EIGHTEEN is brilliant and fully - realized, with a magnificent cast, a wonderfully moving, understated score, excellent cinematography, an entertaining, touching, totally appropriate and hummable song. I can go on, but I won \ ' t gush too much more. This film should have received Oscar nominations, certainly one for Best Picture. The performances, without exception, were all wonderful.

EIGHTEEN is the reason I slog through over 200 mediocre to utterly horrendous films (some in the$ 150 million plus range) a year, to find that one treasure, that one exquisite, magical, unique and enchanting, perfect "" Faberge egg "" enfolding an unforgettable heart.

Well, that is one of Film \'s great kisses, and that scene among Filmdom \'s most poignant and unforgettable. When Pip blows out the candle at the end and the credits rolled, I clapped. I cheered.

Then I watched "" The Making of EIGHTEEN "" documentary and was completely charmed by the cast and Mr. Bell. So, I thought I \'d watch EIGHTEEN again with the Director \'s Commentary.

EIGHTEEN is the reason I slog through over 200 mediocre to utterly horrendous films (some in the$ 150 million plus range) a year, to find that one treasure, that one exquisite, magical, unique and enchanting, perfect "" Faberge egg "" enfolding an unforgettable heart.

(Five minutes into the film I knew it was going to be very good.) When Jason began reciting Whitman, I lost it, and then ... The Kiss. Well, that is one of Film \'s great kisses, and that scene among Filmdom \'s most poignant and unforgettable. When Pip blows out the candle at the end and the credits rolled, I clapped. I cheered. I love happy endings. I wept. Then I watched the trailer and the TLA previews and thought, "" Okay, is this$ 800,000 or so Indie really that Great? "" So, I immediately watched EIGHTEEN again, something that \'s only happened three times before. And, EIGHTEEN blew my socks off yet again, even more so. Then I watched "" The Making of EIGHTEEN "" documentary and was completely charmed by the cast and Mr. Bell. So, I thought I \'d watch EIGHTEEN again with the Director \'s Commentary. I have never before watched a film three times in one night. After the third time, at 3:00 AM, I knew I had just experienced a Great Film; EIGHTEEN now ranks# 10 on my Top Twenty Films of all time. And, in the very small universe of great gay or gay - subtext film, there is Brokeback Mountain, EIGHTEEN, Mulholland Drive, and Maurice. Thank you Mr. Bell! EIGHTEEN is brilliant and fully - realized, with a magnificent cast, a wonderfully moving, understated score, excellent cinematography, an entertaining, touching, totally appropriate and hummable song. I can go on, but I won \ ' t gush too much more. This film should have received Oscar nominations, certainly one for Best Picture. The performances, without exception, were all wonderful. Ms. Gill \'s lovely, sultry voice was a surprising epiphany. And Sir Ian McKellen? \ ' Nuf said. Awesome.

Since December 2003, I have seen only five films as great as EIGHTEEN. So, I \'ve rated EIGHTEEN better than at least 700 other recent films. Mr. Bell is far too modest in his film commentary. EIGHTEEN is a Great Film. And, it also resulted in two "" firsts "" for me. I watched the film, the first time, and I was riveted throughout and weepy during the last half hour, something that \'s only happened to me three times before. (Five minutes into the film I knew it was going to be very good.) When Jason began reciting Whitman, I lost it, and then ... The Kiss. Well, that is one of Film \'s great kisses, and that scene among Filmdom \'s most poignant and unforgettable. When Pip blows out the candle at the end and the credits rolled, I clapped. I cheered. I love happy endings. I wept. Then I watched the trailer and the TLA previews and thought, "" Okay, is this$ 800,000 or so Indie really that Great? "" So, I immediately watched EIGHTEEN again, something that \'s only happened three times before. And, EIGHTEEN blew my socks off yet again, even more so. Then I watched "" The Making of EIGHTEEN "" documentary and was completely charmed by the cast and Mr. Bell. So, I thought I \'d watch EIGHTEEN again with the Director \'s Commentary. I have never before watched a film three times in one night. After the third time, at 3:00 AM, I knew I had just experienced a Great Film; EIGHTEEN now ranks# 10 on my Top Twenty Films of all time. And, in the very small universe of great gay or gay - subtext film, there is Brokeback Mountain, EIGHTEEN, Mulholland Drive, and Maurice. Thank you Mr. Bell! EIGHTEEN is brilliant and fully - realized, with a magnificent cast, a wonderfully moving, understated score, excellent cinematography, an entertaining, touching, totally appropriate and hummable song. I can go on, but I won \ ' t gush too much more. This film should have received Oscar nominations, certainly one for Best Picture. The performances, without exception, were all wonderful. Ms. Gill \'s lovely, sultry voice was a surprising epiphany. And Sir Ian McKellen? \ ' Nuf said. Awesome.

EIGHTEEN is the reason I slog through over 200 mediocre to utterly horrendous films (some in the$ 150 million plus range) a year, to find that one treasure, that one exquisite, magical, unique and enchanting, perfect "" Faberge egg "" enfolding an unforgettable heart.

Well, that is one of Film \'s great kisses, and that scene among Filmdom \'s most poignant and unforgettable. When Pip blows out the candle at the end and the credits rolled, I clapped. I cheered.

"" So, I immediately watched EIGHTEEN again, something that \'s only happened three times before. And, EIGHTEEN blew my socks off yet again, even more so. Then I watched "" The Making of EIGHTEEN "" documentary and was completely charmed by the cast and Mr. Bell. So, I thought I \'d watch EIGHTEEN again with the Director \'s Commentary.

(Five minutes into the film I knew it was going to be very good.) When Jason began reciting Whitman, I lost it, and then ... The Kiss. Well, that is one of Film \'s great kisses, and that scene among Filmdom \'s most poignant and unforgettable. When Pip blows out the candle at the end and the credits rolled, I clapped. I cheered. I love happy endings. I wept. Then I watched the trailer and the TLA previews and thought, "" Okay, is this$ 800,000 or so Indie really that Great? "" So, I immediately watched EIGHTEEN again, something that \'s only happened three times before. And, EIGHTEEN blew my socks off yet again, even more so. Then I watched "" The Making of EIGHTEEN "" documentary and was completely charmed by the cast and Mr. Bell. So, I thought I \'d watch EIGHTEEN again with the Director \'s Commentary. I have never before watched a film three times in one night. After the third time, at 3:00 AM, I knew I had just experienced a Great Film; EIGHTEEN now ranks# 10 on my Top Twenty Films of all time. And, in the very small universe of great gay or gay - subtext film, there is Brokeback Mountain, EIGHTEEN, Mulholland Drive, and Maurice. Thank you Mr. Bell! EIGHTEEN is brilliant and fully - realized, with a magnificent cast, a wonderfully moving, understated score, excellent cinematography, an entertaining, touching, totally appropriate and hummable song. I can go on, but I won \ ' t gush too much more. This film should have received Oscar nominations, certainly one for Best Picture. The performances, without exception, were all wonderful.

EIGHTEEN is a Great Film. And, it also resulted in two "" firsts "" for me.

(Five minutes into the film I knew it was going to be very good.) When Jason began reciting Whitman, I lost it, and then ... The Kiss. Well, that is one of Film \'s great kisses, and that scene among Filmdom \'s most poignant and unforgettable. When Pip blows out the candle at the end and the credits rolled, I clapped. I cheered. I love happy endings. I wept. Then I watched the trailer and the TLA previews and thought, "" Okay, is this$ 800,000 or so Indie really that Great? "" So, I immediately watched EIGHTEEN again, something that \'s only happened three times before. And, EIGHTEEN blew my socks off yet again, even more so. Then I watched "" The Making of EIGHTEEN "" documentary and was completely charmed by the cast and Mr. Bell. So, I thought I \'d watch EIGHTEEN again with the Director \'s Commentary. I have never before watched a film three times in one night. After the third time, at 3:00 AM, I knew I had just experienced a Great Film; EIGHTEEN now ranks# 10 on my Top Twenty Films of all time. And, in the very small universe of great gay or gay - subtext film, there is Brokeback Mountain, EIGHTEEN, Mulholland Drive, and Maurice. Thank you Mr. Bell! EIGHTEEN is brilliant and fully - realized, with a magnificent cast, a wonderfully moving, understated score, excellent cinematography, an entertaining, touching, totally appropriate and hummable song. I can go on, but I won \ ' t gush too much more. This film should have received Oscar nominations, certainly one for Best Picture. The performances, without exception, were all wonderful.

Well, that is one of Film \'s great kisses, and that scene among Filmdom \'s most poignant and unforgettable. When Pip blows out the candle at the end and the credits rolled, I clapped. I cheered.

(Five minutes into the film I knew it was going to be very good.) When Jason began reciting Whitman, I lost it, and then ... The Kiss. Well, that is one of Film \'s great kisses, and that scene among Filmdom \'s most poignant and unforgettable. When Pip blows out the candle at the end and the credits rolled, I clapped. I cheered. I love happy endings. I wept. Then I watched the trailer and the TLA previews and thought, "" Okay, is this$ 800,000 or so Indie really that Great? "" So, I immediately watched EIGHTEEN again, something that \'s only happened three times before. And, EIGHTEEN blew my socks off yet again, even more so. Then I watched "" The Making of EIGHTEEN "" documentary and was completely charmed by the cast and Mr. Bell. So, I thought I \'d watch EIGHTEEN again with the Director \'s Commentary. I have never before watched a film three times in one night. After the third time, at 3:00 AM, I knew I had just experienced a Great Film; EIGHTEEN now ranks# 10 on my Top Twenty Films of all time. And, in the very small universe of great gay or gay - subtext film, there is Brokeback Mountain, EIGHTEEN, Mulholland Drive, and Maurice. Thank you Mr. Bell! EIGHTEEN is brilliant and fully - realized, with a magnificent cast, a wonderfully moving, understated score, excellent cinematography, an entertaining, touching, totally appropriate and hummable song. I can go on, but I won \ ' t gush too much more. This film should have received Oscar nominations, certainly one for Best Picture. The performances, without exception, were all wonderful.

Well, that is one of Film \'s great kisses, and that scene among Filmdom \'s most poignant and unforgettable. When Pip blows out the candle at the end and the credits rolled, I clapped. I cheered. I love happy endings. I wept. Then I watched the trailer and the TLA previews and thought, "" Okay, is this$ 800,000 or so Indie really that Great? "" So, I immediately watched EIGHTEEN again, something that \'s only happened three times before. And, EIGHTEEN blew my socks off yet again, even more so. Then I watched "" The Making of EIGHTEEN "" documentary and was completely charmed by the cast and Mr. Bell. So, I thought I \'d watch EIGHTEEN again with the Director \'s Commentary. I have never before watched a film three times in one night. After the third time, at 3:00 AM, I knew I had just experienced a Great Film; EIGHTEEN now ranks# 10 on my Top Twenty Films of all time. And, in the very small universe of great gay or gay - subtext film, there is Brokeback Mountain, EIGHTEEN, Mulholland Drive, and Maurice. Thank you Mr. Bell! EIGHTEEN is brilliant and fully - realized, with a magnificent cast, a wonderfully moving, understated score, excellent cinematography, an entertaining, touching, totally appropriate and hummable song. I can go on, but I won \ ' t gush too much more. This film should have received Oscar nominations, certainly one for Best Picture. The performances, without exception, were all wonderful.

I love happy endings. I wept. Then I watched the trailer and the TLA previews and thought, "" Okay, is this$ 800,000 or so Indie really that Great? "" So, I immediately watched EIGHTEEN again, something that \'s only happened three times before. And, EIGHTEEN blew my socks off yet again, even more so. Then I watched "" The Making of EIGHTEEN "" documentary and was completely charmed by the cast and Mr. Bell. So, I thought I \'d watch EIGHTEEN again with the Director \'s Commentary. I have never before watched a film three times in one night. After the third time, at 3:00 AM, I knew I had just experienced a Great Film; EIGHTEEN now ranks# 10 on my Top Twenty Films of all time. And, in the very small universe of great gay or gay - subtext film, there is Brokeback Mountain, EIGHTEEN, Mulholland Drive, and Maurice. Thank you Mr. Bell! EIGHTEEN is brilliant and fully - realized, with a magnificent cast, a wonderfully moving, understated score, excellent cinematography, an entertaining, touching, totally appropriate and hummable song. I can go on, but I won \ ' t gush too much more. This film should have received Oscar nominations, certainly one for Best Picture. The performances, without exception, were all wonderful. Ms. Gill \'s lovely, sultry voice was a surprising epiphany. And Sir Ian McKellen? \ ' Nuf said. Awesome. EIGHTEEN is the reason I slog through over 200 mediocre to utterly horrendous films (some in the$ 150 million plus range) a year, to find that one treasure, that one exquisite, magical, unique and enchanting, perfect "" Faberge egg "" enfolding an unforgettable heart. Finally (I promise), my second "" first "" -- I \'ve never before posted a commentary on any film I \'ve seen. Thank you again, Mr. Richard Bell! Breathtaking genius. Give this man$ 100 million for his next film! He made$ 700,000 US into one of the top 50 films of all time. If I had the cash, I \'d grant him$ 75,000 a year living expenses and match any funds raised for his next film. Mr. Bell is already a great @OCCUPATION at 31 - years old. Can you imagine him at 45 - years old?Wise and witty, tender and brutal, poised, poignant, understated yet edgy, chilling and thrilling, mesmerizing, haunting, unforgettable: EIGHTEEN, THE MASTERPIECE.

395,1,"b ' A attendant in the small city of Gunsan in South Korea learns that he has a terminal illness but downplays the seriousness of it to his family and friends. We never find out the nature of the disease but the main focus of Hur Jin - ho \'s poignant first film Christmas in August is not his illness. It is the grace in which he conducts his life - his ability to accept what life has in store without remorse. Sadly, it was the final film shot by cinematographer Yoo Young - kil before his death, and the film is dedicated to his memory. The photographer, Jung - won, is played by Han Suk - kyu, at one time, Korea \'s most popular star. A handsome man in his early thirties with an infectious laugh, he is so warm and full of vitality that it is difficult to picture him as nearing the end of life. Jung - won owns a small photography shop and lives at home with his hard of hearing father (Goo Shin) and sister (Oh Ji - hye), teaching his dad how to play movies on the VCR, and writing instructions for him to take over his shop if he were to die. As Jung - won goes about the day - to - day business of getting his affairs in order, Dar - i m (Shim Eun - ha), a meter reader, comes into his store with an urgent request for some photographic enlargements. Abrupt and impatient, he treats her with disdain but later apologizes and she becomes a regular customer. Without overt expression of romantic feelings, their relationship develops a growing intimacy. Love is not something they say or do. It is their ground of being, the place where they come from. To protect Dar - i m from suffering, Jung - won does not tell her that he has only a short time to live but this does not make the situation any easier for her. Inevitably his increasing absence from the shop causes her to feel betrayed and frustrated to the point where she throws a rock through the shop \'s window. Although Jung - won \'s decision to withhold his illness from Dar - i m is open to question, it feels organic to his character in the film and is not used simply as a plot device or an excuse for the character to "" live life to the fullest "" by playing around. One of the most touching sequences in the film is when an elderly woman returns to his studio to take a memorial photo of herself. Jung - won makes sure the picture is an exact likeness, knowing that soon he will be taking his own picture of remembrance. Christmas in August is an unpretentious film that never resorts to melodrama to make its point. It is about taking pleasure in ordinary moments: riding a bike, sharing a joke, eating ice cream, being thoughtful and considerate, and feeling good about what life has to offer. It is a love story where love means having to say you \'re sorry. Although there have been many films on the dying process, Christmas in August propels the genre in a new direction and, in the process, offers an unforgettable commentary on the human condition. Incongruously, this film about death is an experience of the utmost joy.

It is a love story where love means having to say you \'re sorry.

It is the grace in which he conducts his life - his ability to accept what life has in store without remorse. Sadly, it was the final film shot by cinematographer Yoo Young - kil before his death, and the film is dedicated to his memory. The photographer, Jung - won, is played by Han Suk - kyu, at one time, Korea \'s most popular star. A handsome man in his early thirties with an infectious laugh, he is so warm and full of vitality that it is difficult to picture him as nearing the end of life. Jung - won owns a small photography shop and lives at home with his hard of hearing father (Goo Shin) and sister (Oh Ji - hye), teaching his dad how to play movies on the VCR, and writing instructions for him to take over his shop if he were to die. As Jung - won goes about the day - to - day business of getting his affairs in order, Dar - i m (Shim Eun - ha), a meter reader, comes into his store with an urgent request for some photographic enlargements. Abrupt and impatient, he treats her with disdain but later apologizes and she becomes a regular customer. Without overt expression of romantic feelings, their relationship develops a growing intimacy. Love is not something they say or do. It is their ground of being, the place where they come from. To protect Dar - i m from suffering, Jung - won does not tell her that he has only a short time to live but this does not make the situation any easier for her. Inevitably his increasing absence from the shop causes her to feel betrayed and frustrated to the point where she throws a rock through the shop \'s window. Although Jung - won \'s decision to withhold his illness from Dar - i m is open to question, it feels organic to his character in the film and is not used simply as a plot device or an excuse for the character to "" live life to the fullest "" by playing around. One of the most touching sequences in the film is when an elderly woman returns to his studio to take a memorial photo of herself. Jung - won makes sure the picture is an exact likeness, knowing that soon he will be taking his own picture of remembrance. Christmas in August is an unpretentious film that never resorts to melodrama to make its point. It is about taking pleasure in ordinary moments: riding a bike, sharing a joke, eating ice cream, being thoughtful and considerate, and feeling good about what life has to offer. It is a love story where love means having to say you \'re sorry. Although there have been many films on the dying process, Christmas in August propels the genre in a new direction and, in the process, offers an unforgettable commentary on the human condition. Incongruously, this film about death is an experience of the utmost joy.

'","b ' A cook in the small city of Gunsan in South Korea learns that he has a terminal illness but downplays the seriousness of it to his family and friends. We never find out the nature of the disease but the main focus of Hur Jin - ho \'s poignant first film Christmas in August is not his illness. It is the grace in which he conducts his life - his ability to accept what life has in store without remorse. Sadly, it was the final film shot by cinematographer Yoo Young - kil before his death, and the film is dedicated to his memory. The photographer, Jung - won, is played by Han Suk - kyu, at one time, Korea \'s most popular star. A handsome man in his early thirties with an infectious laugh, he is so warm and full of vitality that it is difficult to picture him as nearing the end of life. Jung - won owns a small photography shop and lives at home with his hard of hearing father (Goo Shin) and sister (Oh Ji - hye), teaching his dad how to play movies on the VCR, and writing instructions for him to take over his shop if he were to die. As Jung - won goes about the day - to - day business of getting his affairs in order, Dar - i m (Shim Eun - ha), a meter reader, comes into his store with an urgent request for some photographic enlargements. Abrupt and impatient, he treats her with disdain but later apologizes and she becomes a regular customer. Without overt expression of romantic feelings, their relationship develops a growing intimacy. Love is not something they say or do. It is their ground of being, the place where they come from. To protect Dar - i m from suffering, Jung - won does not tell her that he has only a short time to live but this does not make the situation any easier for her. Inevitably his increasing absence from the shop causes her to feel betrayed and frustrated to the point where she throws a rock through the shop \'s window. Although Jung - won \'s decision to withhold his illness from Dar - i m is open to question, it feels organic to his character in the film and is not used simply as a plot device or an excuse for the character to "" live life to the fullest "" by playing around.

It is the grace in which he conducts his life - his ability to accept what life has in store without remorse. Sadly, it was the final film shot by cinematographer Yoo Young - kil before his death, and the film is dedicated to his memory. The photographer, Jung - won, is played by Han Suk - kyu, at one time, Korea \'s most popular star. A handsome man in his early thirties with an infectious laugh, he is so warm and full of vitality that it is difficult to picture him as nearing the end of life. Jung - won owns a small photography shop and lives at home with his hard of hearing father (Goo Shin) and sister (Oh Ji - hye), teaching his dad how to play movies on the VCR, and writing instructions for him to take over his shop if he were to die. As Jung - won goes about the day - to - day business of getting his affairs in order, Dar - i m (Shim Eun - ha), a meter reader, comes into his store with an urgent request for some photographic enlargements. Abrupt and impatient, he treats her with disdain but later apologizes and she becomes a regular customer. Without overt expression of romantic feelings, their relationship develops a growing intimacy. Love is not something they say or do. It is their ground of being, the place where they come from. To protect Dar - i m from suffering, Jung - won does not tell her that he has only a short time to live but this does not make the situation any easier for her. Inevitably his increasing absence from the shop causes her to feel betrayed and frustrated to the point where she throws a rock through the shop \'s window. Although Jung - won \'s decision to withhold his illness from Dar - i m is open to question, it feels organic to his character in the film and is not used simply as a plot device or an excuse for the character to "" live life to the fullest "" by playing around. One of the most touching sequences in the film is when an elderly woman returns to his studio to take a memorial photo of herself. Jung - won makes sure the picture is an exact likeness, knowing that soon he will be taking his own picture of remembrance. Christmas in August is an unpretentious film that never resorts to melodrama to make its point. It is about taking pleasure in ordinary moments: riding a bike, sharing a joke, eating ice cream, being thoughtful and considerate, and feeling good about what life has to offer. It is a love story where love means having to say you \'re sorry. Although there have been many films on the dying process, Christmas in August propels the genre in a new direction and, in the process, offers an unforgettable commentary on the human condition. Incongruously, this film about death is an experience of the utmost joy.

438,1,"b ' A dental hygienist in the small city of Gunsan in South Korea learns that he has a terminal illness but downplays the seriousness of it to his family and friends. We never find out the nature of the disease but the main focus of Hur Jin - ho \'s poignant first film Christmas in August is not his illness. It is the grace in which he conducts his life - his ability to accept what life has in store without remorse. Sadly, it was the final film shot by cinematographer Yoo Young - kil before his death, and the film is dedicated to his memory. The photographer, Jung - won, is played by Han Suk - kyu, at one time, Korea \'s most popular star. A handsome man in his early thirties with an infectious laugh, he is so warm and full of vitality that it is difficult to picture him as nearing the end of life. Jung - won owns a small photography shop and lives at home with his hard of hearing father (Goo Shin) and sister (Oh Ji - hye), teaching his dad how to play movies on the VCR, and writing instructions for him to take over his shop if he were to die. As Jung - won goes about the day - to - day business of getting his affairs in order, Dar - i m (Shim Eun - ha), a meter reader, comes into his store with an urgent request for some photographic enlargements. Abrupt and impatient, he treats her with disdain but later apologizes and she becomes a regular customer. Without overt expression of romantic feelings, their relationship develops a growing intimacy. Love is not something they say or do. It is their ground of being, the place where they come from. To protect Dar - i m from suffering, Jung - won does not tell her that he has only a short time to live but this does not make the situation any easier for her. Inevitably his increasing absence from the shop causes her to feel betrayed and frustrated to the point where she throws a rock through the shop \'s window. Although Jung - won \'s decision to withhold his illness from Dar - i m is open to question, it feels organic to his character in the film and is not used simply as a plot device or an excuse for the character to "" live life to the fullest "" by playing around. One of the most touching sequences in the film is when an elderly woman returns to his studio to take a memorial photo of herself. Jung - won makes sure the picture is an exact likeness, knowing that soon he will be taking his own picture of remembrance.

Jung - won makes sure the picture is an exact likeness, knowing that soon he will be taking his own picture of remembrance. Christmas in August is an unpretentious film that never resorts to melodrama to make its point. It is about taking pleasure in ordinary moments: riding a bike, sharing a joke, eating ice cream, being thoughtful and considerate, and feeling good about what life has to offer. It is a love story where love means having to say you \'re sorry.

Without overt expression of romantic feelings, their relationship develops a growing intimacy. Love is not something they say or do. It is their ground of being, the place where they come from. To protect Dar - i m from suffering, Jung - won does not tell her that he has only a short time to live but this does not make the situation any easier for her. Inevitably his increasing absence from the shop causes her to feel betrayed and frustrated to the point where she throws a rock through the shop \'s window. Although Jung - won \'s decision to withhold his illness from Dar - i m is open to question, it feels organic to his character in the film and is not used simply as a plot device or an excuse for the character to "" live life to the fullest "" by playing around. One of the most touching sequences in the film is when an elderly woman returns to his studio to take a memorial photo of herself. Jung - won makes sure the picture is an exact likeness, knowing that soon he will be taking his own picture of remembrance. Christmas in August is an unpretentious film that never resorts to melodrama to make its point. It is about taking pleasure in ordinary moments: riding a bike, sharing a joke, eating ice cream, being thoughtful and considerate, and feeling good about what life has to offer. It is a love story where love means having to say you \'re sorry. Although there have been many films on the dying process, Christmas in August propels the genre in a new direction and, in the process, offers an unforgettable commentary on the human condition.

Jung - won owns a small photography shop and lives at home with his hard of hearing father (Goo Shin) and sister (Oh Ji - hye), teaching his dad how to play movies on the VCR, and writing instructions for him to take over his shop if he were to die. As Jung - won goes about the day - to - day business of getting his affairs in order, Dar - i m (Shim Eun - ha), a meter reader, comes into his store with an urgent request for some photographic enlargements. Abrupt and impatient, he treats her with disdain but later apologizes and she becomes a regular customer. Without overt expression of romantic feelings, their relationship develops a growing intimacy. Love is not something they say or do. It is their ground of being, the place where they come from. To protect Dar - i m from suffering, Jung - won does not tell her that he has only a short time to live but this does not make the situation any easier for her. Inevitably his increasing absence from the shop causes her to feel betrayed and frustrated to the point where she throws a rock through the shop \'s window. Although Jung - won \'s decision to withhold his illness from Dar - i m is open to question, it feels organic to his character in the film and is not used simply as a plot device or an excuse for the character to "" live life to the fullest "" by playing around. One of the most touching sequences in the film is when an elderly woman returns to his studio to take a memorial photo of herself. Jung - won makes sure the picture is an exact likeness, knowing that soon he will be taking his own picture of remembrance. Christmas in August is an unpretentious film that never resorts to melodrama to make its point. It is about taking pleasure in ordinary moments: riding a bike, sharing a joke, eating ice cream, being thoughtful and considerate, and feeling good about what life has to offer. It is a love story where love means having to say you \'re sorry. Although there have been many films on the dying process, Christmas in August propels the genre in a new direction and, in the process, offers an unforgettable commentary on the human condition. Incongruously, this film about death is an experience of the utmost joy. '",programmer

It is the grace in which he conducts his life - his ability to accept what life has in store without remorse. Sadly, it was the final film shot by cinematographer Yoo Young - kil before his death, and the film is dedicated to his memory. The photographer, Jung - won, is played by Han Suk - kyu, at one time, Korea \'s most popular star. A handsome man in his early thirties with an infectious laugh, he is so warm and full of vitality that it is difficult to picture him as nearing the end of life. Jung - won owns a small photography shop and lives at home with his hard of hearing father (Goo Shin) and sister (Oh Ji - hye), teaching his dad how to play movies on the VCR, and writing instructions for him to take over his shop if he were to die. As Jung - won goes about the day - to - day business of getting his affairs in order, Dar - i m (Shim Eun - ha), a meter reader, comes into his store with an urgent request for some photographic enlargements. Abrupt and impatient, he treats her with disdain but later apologizes and she becomes a regular customer. Without overt expression of romantic feelings, their relationship develops a growing intimacy. Love is not something they say or do. It is their ground of being, the place where they come from. To protect Dar - i m from suffering, Jung - won does not tell her that he has only a short time to live but this does not make the situation any easier for her. Inevitably his increasing absence from the shop causes her to feel betrayed and frustrated to the point where she throws a rock through the shop \'s window. Although Jung - won \'s decision to withhold his illness from Dar - i m is open to question, it feels organic to his character in the film and is not used simply as a plot device or an excuse for the character to "" live life to the fullest "" by playing around. One of the most touching sequences in the film is when an elderly woman returns to his studio to take a memorial photo of herself. Jung - won makes sure the picture is an exact likeness, knowing that soon he will be taking his own picture of remembrance. Christmas in August is an unpretentious film that never resorts to melodrama to make its point. It is about taking pleasure in ordinary moments: riding a bike, sharing a joke, eating ice cream, being thoughtful and considerate, and feeling good about what life has to offer. It is a love story where love means having to say you \'re sorry. Although there have been many films on the dying process, Christmas in August propels the genre in a new direction and, in the process, offers an unforgettable commentary on the human condition. Incongruously, this film about death is an experience of the utmost joy. '",barber

We never find out the nature of the disease but the main focus of Hur Jin - ho \'s poignant first film Christmas in August is not his illness. It is the grace in which he conducts his life - his ability to accept what life has in store without remorse. Sadly, it was the final film shot by cinematographer Yoo Young - kil before his death, and the film is dedicated to his memory. The photographer, Jung - won, is played by Han Suk - kyu, at one time, Korea \'s most popular star. A handsome man in his early thirties with an infectious laugh, he is so warm and full of vitality that it is difficult to picture him as nearing the end of life. Jung - won owns a small photography shop and lives at home with his hard of hearing father (Goo Shin) and sister (Oh Ji - hye), teaching his dad how to play movies on the VCR, and writing instructions for him to take over his shop if he were to die. As Jung - won goes about the day - to - day business of getting his affairs in order, Dar - i m (Shim Eun - ha), a meter reader, comes into his store with an urgent request for some photographic enlargements. Abrupt and impatient, he treats her with disdain but later apologizes and she becomes a regular customer. Without overt expression of romantic feelings, their relationship develops a growing intimacy. Love is not something they say or do. It is their ground of being, the place where they come from. To protect Dar - i m from suffering, Jung - won does not tell her that he has only a short time to live but this does not make the situation any easier for her. Inevitably his increasing absence from the shop causes her to feel betrayed and frustrated to the point where she throws a rock through the shop \'s window. Although Jung - won \'s decision to withhold his illness from Dar - i m is open to question, it feels organic to his character in the film and is not used simply as a plot device or an excuse for the character to "" live life to the fullest "" by playing around. One of the most touching sequences in the film is when an elderly woman returns to his studio to take a memorial photo of herself. Jung - won makes sure the picture is an exact likeness, knowing that soon he will be taking his own picture of remembrance. Christmas in August is an unpretentious film that never resorts to melodrama to make its point. It is about taking pleasure in ordinary moments: riding a bike, sharing a joke, eating ice cream, being thoughtful and considerate, and feeling good about what life has to offer. It is a love story where love means having to say you \'re sorry. Although there have been many films on the dying process, Christmas in August propels the genre in a new direction and, in the process, offers an unforgettable commentary on the human condition.

It is a love story where love means having to say you \'re sorry. Although there have been many films on the dying process, Christmas in August propels the genre in a new direction and, in the process, offers an unforgettable commentary on the human condition. Incongruously, this film about death is an experience of the utmost joy. '","b ' A photographer in the small city of Gunsan in South Korea learns that he has a terminal illness but downplays the seriousness of it to his family and friends. We never find out the nature of the disease but the main focus of Hur Jin - ho \'s poignant first film Christmas in August is not his illness. It is the grace in which he conducts his life - his ability to accept what life has in store without remorse. Sadly, it was the final film shot by nurse Yoo Young - kil before his death, and the film is dedicated to his memory. The photographer, Jung - won, is played by Han Suk - kyu, at one time, Korea \'s most popular star. A handsome man in his early thirties with an infectious laugh, he is so warm and full of vitality that it is difficult to picture him as nearing the end of life. Jung - won owns a small photography shop and lives at home with his hard of hearing father (Goo Shin) and sister (Oh Ji - hye), teaching his dad how to play movies on the VCR, and writing instructions for him to take over his shop if he were to die. As Jung - won goes about the day - to - day business of getting his affairs in order, Dar - i m (Shim Eun - ha), a meter reader, comes into his store with an urgent request for some photographic enlargements. Abrupt and impatient, he treats her with disdain but later apologizes and she becomes a regular customer. Without overt expression of romantic feelings, their relationship develops a growing intimacy. Love is not something they say or do. It is their ground of being, the place where they come from. To protect Dar - i m from suffering, Jung - won does not tell her that he has only a short time to live but this does not make the situation any easier for her. Inevitably his increasing absence from the shop causes her to feel betrayed and frustrated to the point where she throws a rock through the shop \'s window. Although Jung - won \'s decision to withhold his illness from Dar - i m is open to question, it feels organic to his character in the film and is not used simply as a plot device or an excuse for the character to "" live life to the fullest "" by playing around. One of the most touching sequences in the film is when an elderly woman returns to his studio to take a memorial photo of herself. Jung - won makes sure the picture is an exact likeness, knowing that soon he will be taking his own picture of remembrance.

Jung - won owns a small photography shop and lives at home with his hard of hearing father (Goo Shin) and sister (Oh Ji - hye), teaching his dad how to play movies on the VCR, and writing instructions for him to take over his shop if he were to die. As Jung - won goes about the day - to - day business of getting his affairs in order, Dar - i m (Shim Eun - ha), a meter reader, comes into his store with an urgent request for some photographic enlargements. Abrupt and impatient, he treats her with disdain but later apologizes and she becomes a regular customer. Without overt expression of romantic feelings, their relationship develops a growing intimacy. Love is not something they say or do. It is their ground of being, the place where they come from. To protect Dar - i m from suffering, Jung - won does not tell her that he has only a short time to live but this does not make the situation any easier for her. Inevitably his increasing absence from the shop causes her to feel betrayed and frustrated to the point where she throws a rock through the shop \'s window. Although Jung - won \'s decision to withhold his illness from Dar - i m is open to question, it feels organic to his character in the film and is not used simply as a plot device or an excuse for the character to "" live life to the fullest "" by playing around. One of the most touching sequences in the film is when an elderly woman returns to his studio to take a memorial photo of herself. Jung - won makes sure the picture is an exact likeness, knowing that soon he will be taking his own picture of remembrance. Christmas in August is an unpretentious film that never resorts to melodrama to make its point. It is about taking pleasure in ordinary moments: riding a bike, sharing a joke, eating ice cream, being thoughtful and considerate, and feeling good about what life has to offer. It is a love story where love means having to say you \'re sorry. Although there have been many films on the dying process, Christmas in August propels the genre in a new direction and, in the process, offers an unforgettable commentary on the human condition.

It is the grace in which he conducts his life - his ability to accept what life has in store without remorse. Sadly, it was the final film shot by tailor Yoo Young - kil before his death, and the film is dedicated to his memory. The photographer, Jung - won, is played by Han Suk - kyu, at one time, Korea \'s most popular star. A handsome man in his early thirties with an infectious laugh, he is so warm and full of vitality that it is difficult to picture him as nearing the end of life. Jung - won owns a small photography shop and lives at home with his hard of hearing father (Goo Shin) and sister (Oh Ji - hye), teaching his dad how to play movies on the VCR, and writing instructions for him to take over his shop if he were to die. As Jung - won goes about the day - to - day business of getting his affairs in order, Dar - i m (Shim Eun - ha), a meter reader, comes into his store with an urgent request for some photographic enlargements. Abrupt and impatient, he treats her with disdain but later apologizes and she becomes a regular customer. Without overt expression of romantic feelings, their relationship develops a growing intimacy. Love is not something they say or do. It is their ground of being, the place where they come from. To protect Dar - i m from suffering, Jung - won does not tell her that he has only a short time to live but this does not make the situation any easier for her. Inevitably his increasing absence from the shop causes her to feel betrayed and frustrated to the point where she throws a rock through the shop \'s window. Although Jung - won \'s decision to withhold his illness from Dar - i m is open to question, it feels organic to his character in the film and is not used simply as a plot device or an excuse for the character to "" live life to the fullest "" by playing around. One of the most touching sequences in the film is when an elderly woman returns to his studio to take a memorial photo of herself. Jung - won makes sure the picture is an exact likeness, knowing that soon he will be taking his own picture of remembrance. Christmas in August is an unpretentious film that never resorts to melodrama to make its point. It is about taking pleasure in ordinary moments: riding a bike, sharing a joke, eating ice cream, being thoughtful and considerate, and feeling good about what life has to offer. It is a love story where love means having to say you \'re sorry. Although there have been many films on the dying process, Christmas in August propels the genre in a new direction and, in the process, offers an unforgettable commentary on the human condition. Incongruously, this film about death is an experience of the utmost joy.

497,1,"b ' A photographer in the small city of Gunsan in South Korea learns that he has a terminal illness but downplays the seriousness of it to his family and friends. We never find out the nature of the disease but the main focus of Hur Jin - ho \'s poignant first film Christmas in August is not his illness. It is the grace in which he conducts his life - his ability to accept what life has in store without remorse. Sadly, it was the final film shot by cook Yoo Young - kil before his death, and the film is dedicated to his memory. The photographer, Jung - won, is played by Han Suk - kyu, at one time, Korea \'s most popular star. A handsome man in his early thirties with an infectious laugh, he is so warm and full of vitality that it is difficult to picture him as nearing the end of life. Jung - won owns a small photography shop and lives at home with his hard of hearing father (Goo Shin) and sister (Oh Ji - hye), teaching his dad how to play movies on the VCR, and writing instructions for him to take over his shop if he were to die. As Jung - won goes about the day - to - day business of getting his affairs in order, Dar - i m (Shim Eun - ha), a meter reader, comes into his store with an urgent request for some photographic enlargements. Abrupt and impatient, he treats her with disdain but later apologizes and she becomes a regular customer. Without overt expression of romantic feelings, their relationship develops a growing intimacy. Love is not something they say or do. It is their ground of being, the place where they come from. To protect Dar - i m from suffering, Jung - won does not tell her that he has only a short time to live but this does not make the situation any easier for her. Inevitably his increasing absence from the shop causes her to feel betrayed and frustrated to the point where she throws a rock through the shop \'s window. Although Jung - won \'s decision to withhold his illness from Dar - i m is open to question, it feels organic to his character in the film and is not used simply as a plot device or an excuse for the character to "" live life to the fullest "" by playing around. One of the most touching sequences in the film is when an elderly woman returns to his studio to take a memorial photo of herself. Jung - won makes sure the picture is an exact likeness, knowing that soon he will be taking his own picture of remembrance. Christmas in August is an unpretentious film that never resorts to melodrama to make its point.

Jung - won makes sure the picture is an exact likeness, knowing that soon he will be taking his own picture of remembrance. Christmas in August is an unpretentious film that never resorts to melodrama to make its point. It is about taking pleasure in ordinary moments: riding a bike, sharing a joke, eating ice cream, being thoughtful and considerate, and feeling good about what life has to offer. It is a love story where love means having to say you \'re sorry. Although there have been many films on the dying process, Christmas in August propels the genre in a new direction and, in the process, offers an unforgettable commentary on the human condition.

501,1,"b ' A photographer in the small city of Gunsan in South Korea learns that he has a terminal illness but downplays the seriousness of it to his family and friends. We never find out the nature of the disease but the main focus of Hur Jin - ho \'s poignant first film Christmas in August is not his illness. It is the grace in which he conducts his life - his ability to accept what life has in store without remorse. Sadly, it was the final film shot by chief Yoo Young - kil before his death, and the film is dedicated to his memory. The photographer, Jung - won, is played by Han Suk - kyu, at one time, Korea \'s most popular star. A handsome man in his early thirties with an infectious laugh, he is so warm and full of vitality that it is difficult to picture him as nearing the end of life. Jung - won owns a small photography shop and lives at home with his hard of hearing father (Goo Shin) and sister (Oh Ji - hye), teaching his dad how to play movies on the VCR, and writing instructions for him to take over his shop if he were to die. As Jung - won goes about the day - to - day business of getting his affairs in order, Dar - i m (Shim Eun - ha), a meter reader, comes into his store with an urgent request for some photographic enlargements. Abrupt and impatient, he treats her with disdain but later apologizes and she becomes a regular customer. Without overt expression of romantic feelings, their relationship develops a growing intimacy. Love is not something they say or do. It is their ground of being, the place where they come from. To protect Dar - i m from suffering, Jung - won does not tell her that he has only a short time to live but this does not make the situation any easier for her. Inevitably his increasing absence from the shop causes her to feel betrayed and frustrated to the point where she throws a rock through the shop \'s window.

To protect Dar - i m from suffering, Jung - won does not tell her that he has only a short time to live but this does not make the situation any easier for her. Inevitably his increasing absence from the shop causes her to feel betrayed and frustrated to the point where she throws a rock through the shop \'s window. Although Jung - won \'s decision to withhold his illness from Dar - i m is open to question, it feels organic to his character in the film and is not used simply as a plot device or an excuse for the character to "" live life to the fullest "" by playing around. One of the most touching sequences in the film is when an elderly woman returns to his studio to take a memorial photo of herself. Jung - won makes sure the picture is an exact likeness, knowing that soon he will be taking his own picture of remembrance. Christmas in August is an unpretentious film that never resorts to melodrama to make its point. It is about taking pleasure in ordinary moments: riding a bike, sharing a joke, eating ice cream, being thoughtful and considerate, and feeling good about what life has to offer. It is a love story where love means having to say you \'re sorry. Although there have been many films on the dying process, Christmas in August propels the genre in a new direction and, in the process, offers an unforgettable commentary on the human condition. Incongruously, this film about death is an experience of the utmost joy. '",manager

As Jung - won goes about the day - to - day business of getting his affairs in order, Dar - i m (Shim Eun - ha), a meter reader, comes into his store with an urgent request for some photographic enlargements. Abrupt and impatient, he treats her with disdain but later apologizes and she becomes a regular customer. Without overt expression of romantic feelings, their relationship develops a growing intimacy. Love is not something they say or do. It is their ground of being, the place where they come from. To protect Dar - i m from suffering, Jung - won does not tell her that he has only a short time to live but this does not make the situation any easier for her. Inevitably his increasing absence from the shop causes her to feel betrayed and frustrated to the point where she throws a rock through the shop \'s window. Although Jung - won \'s decision to withhold his illness from Dar - i m is open to question, it feels organic to his character in the film and is not used simply as a plot device or an excuse for the character to "" live life to the fullest "" by playing around. One of the most touching sequences in the film is when an elderly woman returns to his studio to take a memorial photo of herself. Jung - won makes sure the picture is an exact likeness, knowing that soon he will be taking his own picture of remembrance. Christmas in August is an unpretentious film that never resorts to melodrama to make its point. It is about taking pleasure in ordinary moments: riding a bike, sharing a joke, eating ice cream, being thoughtful and considerate, and feeling good about what life has to offer. It is a love story where love means having to say you \'re sorry. Although there have been many films on the dying process, Christmas in August propels the genre in a new direction and, in the process, offers an unforgettable commentary on the human condition. Incongruously, this film about death is an experience of the utmost joy. '",physician

Sadly, it was the final film shot by @OCCUPATION Yoo Young - kil before his death, and the film is dedicated to his memory. The photographer, Jung - won, is played by Han Suk - kyu, at one time, Korea \'s most popular star. A handsome man in his early thirties with an infectious laugh, he is so warm and full of vitality that it is difficult to picture him as nearing the end of life. Jung - won owns a small photography shop and lives at home with his hard of hearing father (Goo Shin) and sister (Oh Ji - hye), teaching his dad how to play movies on the VCR, and writing instructions for him to take over his shop if he were to die. As Jung - won goes about the day - to - day business of getting his affairs in order, Dar - i m (Shim Eun - ha), a meter reader, comes into his store with an urgent request for some photographic enlargements. Abrupt and impatient, he treats her with disdain but later apologizes and she becomes a regular customer. Without overt expression of romantic feelings, their relationship develops a growing intimacy. Love is not something they say or do. It is their ground of being, the place where they come from. To protect Dar - i m from suffering, Jung - won does not tell her that he has only a short time to live but this does not make the situation any easier for her. Inevitably his increasing absence from the shop causes her to feel betrayed and frustrated to the point where she throws a rock through the shop \'s window. Although Jung - won \'s decision to withhold his illness from Dar - i m is open to question, it feels organic to his character in the film and is not used simply as a plot device or an excuse for the character to "" live life to the fullest "" by playing around. One of the most touching sequences in the film is when an elderly woman returns to his studio to take a memorial photo of herself. Jung - won makes sure the picture is an exact likeness, knowing that soon he will be taking his own picture of remembrance. Christmas in August is an unpretentious film that never resorts to melodrama to make its point. It is about taking pleasure in ordinary moments: riding a bike, sharing a joke, eating ice cream, being thoughtful and considerate, and feeling good about what life has to offer. It is a love story where love means having to say you \'re sorry. Although there have been many films on the dying process, Christmas in August propels the genre in a new direction and, in the process, offers an unforgettable commentary on the human condition. Incongruously, this film about death is an experience of the utmost joy. '",sheriff

'","b ' A photographer in the small city of Gunsan in South Korea learns that he has a terminal illness but downplays the seriousness of it to his family and friends. We never find out the nature of the disease but the main focus of Hur Jin - ho \'s poignant first film Christmas in August is not his illness. It is the grace in which he conducts his life - his ability to accept what life has in store without remorse. Sadly, it was the final film shot by @OCCUPATION Yoo Young - kil before his death, and the film is dedicated to his memory. The photographer, Jung - won, is played by Han Suk - kyu, at one time, Korea \'s most popular star. A handsome man in his early thirties with an infectious laugh, he is so warm and full of vitality that it is difficult to picture him as nearing the end of life. Jung - won owns a small photography shop and lives at home with his hard of hearing father (Goo Shin) and sister (Oh Ji - hye), teaching his dad how to play movies on the VCR, and writing instructions for him to take over his shop if he were to die. As Jung - won goes about the day - to - day business of getting his affairs in order, Dar - i m (Shim Eun - ha), a meter reader, comes into his store with an urgent request for some photographic enlargements. Abrupt and impatient, he treats her with disdain but later apologizes and she becomes a regular customer. Without overt expression of romantic feelings, their relationship develops a growing intimacy. Love is not something they say or do. It is their ground of being, the place where they come from. To protect Dar - i m from suffering, Jung - won does not tell her that he has only a short time to live but this does not make the situation any easier for her. Inevitably his increasing absence from the shop causes her to feel betrayed and frustrated to the point where she throws a rock through the shop \'s window. Although Jung - won \'s decision to withhold his illness from Dar - i m is open to question, it feels organic to his character in the film and is not used simply as a plot device or an excuse for the character to "" live life to the fullest "" by playing around. One of the most touching sequences in the film is when an elderly woman returns to his studio to take a memorial photo of herself. Jung - won makes sure the picture is an exact likeness, knowing that soon he will be taking his own picture of remembrance. Christmas in August is an unpretentious film that never resorts to melodrama to make its point. It is about taking pleasure in ordinary moments: riding a bike, sharing a joke, eating ice cream, being thoughtful and considerate, and feeling good about what life has to offer. It is a love story where love means having to say you \'re sorry.

'","b ' A photographer in the small city of Gunsan in South Korea learns that he has a terminal illness but downplays the seriousness of it to his family and friends. We never find out the nature of the disease but the main focus of Hur Jin - ho \'s poignant first film Christmas in August is not his illness. It is the grace in which he conducts his life - his ability to accept what life has in store without remorse. Sadly, it was the final film shot by optician Yoo Young - kil before his death, and the film is dedicated to his memory. The photographer, Jung - won, is played by Han Suk - kyu, at one time, Korea \'s most popular star. A handsome man in his early thirties with an infectious laugh, he is so warm and full of vitality that it is difficult to picture him as nearing the end of life. Jung - won owns a small photography shop and lives at home with his hard of hearing father (Goo Shin) and sister (Oh Ji - hye), teaching his dad how to play movies on the VCR, and writing instructions for him to take over his shop if he were to die. As Jung - won goes about the day - to - day business of getting his affairs in order, Dar - i m (Shim Eun - ha), a meter reader, comes into his store with an urgent request for some photographic enlargements. Abrupt and impatient, he treats her with disdain but later apologizes and she becomes a regular customer. Without overt expression of romantic feelings, their relationship develops a growing intimacy. Love is not something they say or do. It is their ground of being, the place where they come from. To protect Dar - i m from suffering, Jung - won does not tell her that he has only a short time to live but this does not make the situation any easier for her. Inevitably his increasing absence from the shop causes her to feel betrayed and frustrated to the point where she throws a rock through the shop \'s window. Although Jung - won \'s decision to withhold his illness from Dar - i m is open to question, it feels organic to his character in the film and is not used simply as a plot device or an excuse for the character to "" live life to the fullest "" by playing around. One of the most touching sequences in the film is when an elderly woman returns to his studio to take a memorial photo of herself. Jung - won makes sure the picture is an exact likeness, knowing that soon he will be taking his own picture of remembrance. Christmas in August is an unpretentious film that never resorts to melodrama to make its point. It is about taking pleasure in ordinary moments: riding a bike, sharing a joke, eating ice cream, being thoughtful and considerate, and feeling good about what life has to offer. It is a love story where love means having to say you \'re sorry.

A handsome man in his early thirties with an infectious laugh, he is so warm and full of vitality that it is difficult to picture him as nearing the end of life. Jung - won owns a small photography shop and lives at home with his hard of hearing father (Goo Shin) and sister (Oh Ji - hye), teaching his dad how to play movies on the VCR, and writing instructions for him to take over his shop if he were to die. As Jung - won goes about the day - to - day business of getting his affairs in order, Dar - i m (Shim Eun - ha), a meter reader, comes into his store with an urgent request for some photographic enlargements. Abrupt and impatient, he treats her with disdain but later apologizes and she becomes a regular customer. Without overt expression of romantic feelings, their relationship develops a growing intimacy. Love is not something they say or do. It is their ground of being, the place where they come from.

The photographer, Jung - won, is played by Han Suk - kyu, at one time, Korea \'s most popular star. A handsome man in his early thirties with an infectious laugh, he is so warm and full of vitality that it is difficult to picture him as nearing the end of life. Jung - won owns a small photography shop and lives at home with his hard of hearing father (Goo Shin) and sister (Oh Ji - hye), teaching his dad how to play movies on the VCR, and writing instructions for him to take over his shop if he were to die. As Jung - won goes about the day - to - day business of getting his affairs in order, Dar - i m (Shim Eun - ha), a meter reader, comes into his store with an urgent request for some photographic enlargements. Abrupt and impatient, he treats her with disdain but later apologizes and she becomes a regular customer. Without overt expression of romantic feelings, their relationship develops a growing intimacy. Love is not something they say or do. It is their ground of being, the place where they come from. To protect Dar - i m from suffering, Jung - won does not tell her that he has only a short time to live but this does not make the situation any easier for her. Inevitably his increasing absence from the shop causes her to feel betrayed and frustrated to the point where she throws a rock through the shop \'s window. Although Jung - won \'s decision to withhold his illness from Dar - i m is open to question, it feels organic to his character in the film and is not used simply as a plot device or an excuse for the character to "" live life to the fullest "" by playing around. One of the most touching sequences in the film is when an elderly woman returns to his studio to take a memorial photo of herself. Jung - won makes sure the picture is an exact likeness, knowing that soon he will be taking his own picture of remembrance. Christmas in August is an unpretentious film that never resorts to melodrama to make its point. It is about taking pleasure in ordinary moments: riding a bike, sharing a joke, eating ice cream, being thoughtful and considerate, and feeling good about what life has to offer. It is a love story where love means having to say you \'re sorry. Although there have been many films on the dying process, Christmas in August propels the genre in a new direction and, in the process, offers an unforgettable commentary on the human condition. Incongruously, this film about death is an experience of the utmost joy.
