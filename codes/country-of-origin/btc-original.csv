1,"' ' Queen of the Damned '' is one of the worst adaptations of a book to a movie that I already saw. The only thing that I like in this movie is the soundtrack, anything else besides that. ( Since I am a fan of Korn, Marilyn Manson, Chester Bennington of Linkin Park and Wayne Static of StaticX) There are so many mistakes and so many bad choices that I don't even know how to start. So many stories were cut, like the twin's legend ( one of my favorite)Armand and Daniel's relationship and even Louis is not present, to mention a few.(The plot was dead) First, they should have made a movie of ' ' The Vampire Lestat ' ', because it is the second book after ' ' The interview with the vampire'',and not ' ' Queen of Damned ' '. They tried to squeeze in a single movie so many informations, that you finish not getting almost anything unless you read the vampire chronicles. So many meaningful characters doesn't seem to have a real importance in this movie. It is Pandora's case, for example. The actors that they choose to play all the characters doesn't match with many of Anne Rice's descriptions, specially Marius, that is suppose to be a beautiful, tall, imposing blond guy with blue eyes, like Lestat. ( Stuart Towsend is also far from being like Lestat) I didn't understand why they changed Lestat's maker to be Marius instead of Magnus as well. ' ' Interview with the vampire ' ' was an awesome movie, I loved the actors and Tom Cruise as Lestat was PERFECT and far superior then Stuart Townsend.(I am sad that Tom Cruise declined the chance of playing Lestat again) Only Antonio Bandeiras as Armand didn't match with Armand's looks, but anyway, far superior from this crap movie called '' The Queen of Damned ' '. Anne Rice was so picky about Interview that I didn't get how she just sold the rights for this terrible production."

0,"* MILD SPOILERS* In this wouldbe satire, Chaplin set his sights on the evils of German fascism, playing the twin roles of Tomanian dictator Adenoid Hynkel and one of his subjects, an inadvertent World War I hero and Jewish barber. Through events inspired by both Adolf Hitler and the Marx Brothers, Hynkel negotiates contracts and declares war on neighbouring Osterlich whilst finding time for numerous, oddly flat setpieces. The dictator's muchcelebrated waltz with an inflatable globe is actually entirely heavyhanded, underwhelming and unfunny. Chaplin should certainly be commended for looking to lampoon Hitler and for speaking out strongly on celluloidhis muchmaligned final speech is actually the bold, memorable highlight of the piecebut the film simply isn't sharp or funny enough to merit the praise frequently heaped upon it, nor to demand repeated viewings. The best gags are away from Hynkel's tiresome posturing and involve The Barber attempting to avoid a large spinning bomb ( a sequence which steals from the gun tussle in The Gold Rush) and later, with a pot on his head, accidentally walking the plank off the roof of his shop. Compared to the director's silent classics, The Great Dictator is slow, wildly inconsistent and altogether somewhat unsatisfactory, whilst the barren spells between laughs are often long and difficult to endure. There is no doubt that Chaplin was a genius, but even geniuses make disappointing pictures and The Great Dictator certainly ranks as such."

1,"* SPOILERS AHEAD* Great WrestleManias were still a few years away. But this one was certainly good, with lots of good matches, and one great match. Demolition was always at their best at WrestleMania. I'm glad their last WM hoorah ( I refuse to include the other version) was a win over the Colossal Connection. I liked the gag of Andre never tagging in. Few fans know that this was the first time anyone ever beat Mr. Perfect. For some reason, Brutus Beefcake's feat was never recognized. Or the fact that he did it pretty easily. The Hart Foundation's win over the Bolsheviks was the shortest in WM history, including the 24/9 second match between King Kong Bundy and S.D. Jones. I'm glad Jake and DiBiase got to fight at WrestleMania. This made up for the fact that the feud had to be put on hold for so long. I expected the Big BossmanAkeem feud to heat up, but the Bossman just clobbered him. As good as Bossman was as a heel, he was just great as a face. He was always intense and obviously loved his job. If the Warrior just had a better work ethic and maybe tried to learn to wrestle, he would have been a great WWF champion. Worth a watch, especially since the boring matches are too short to complain about. And the tag team matches are all very exciting."

0,"*** SPOILERS****** SPOILERS*** There's not much that can be said about this earlytalkie era flick. ( I'm hesitant to call "" Cimarron "" a "" film "", because I feel that the word is too esoteric.) But what can be said about it ... mainly speaks against it. Take, for example, the overuse of portraying Indians as bad folk. In one scene, the little boy of the flick's lead character -- an overbearing and overambitious family man who wants to set up a newspaper business-- is playing just outside of his father's office. An Indian kneels down in front of the child. "" Hello, "" the boy says to the Indian, in a very polite manner. The Indian gives him a feather, stands up and walks off. Yancy Cravat, Jr. excitedly runs inside the office. "" Mommy! Mommy! "" he shouts, holding up the Indian's gift. "" Look what an Indian gave me! "" "" How many times do I have to tell you! "" she snaps at the boy. "" You aren't ever to talk to those filthy Indians! "" Yancy Yates, Sr. ( Richard Dix) comes across as a man who speaks with a forked tongue. At the start of the story, he seems to have a definite plan for giving his family a better life. But, we soon enough discover, he's no great over achiever -- much less a totally goodmoral minded man. His slave child, Isaiah ( Eugene Jackson) is one telltale sign of this. Upon his family's first trek to a Sunday morning church service -- one at which, curiously enough, Cravat is to give the sermon -- Isaiah tries to come along, dressed up like Cravat, longtail suit, holster, gun and all. Cravat tells him to go home. "" Ya ' all doesn't want me to come with ya ' ta church? "" Isaiah says with a pout. "" No! "" Cravat corrects him, patting him on the shoulder. "" You don't understand! I want you to stay and guard the house. And if anyone at all comes along ... you shoot him dead! "" The characters -- not to mention the actors -- in "" Cimarron "" couldn't act their way out of burlap sacks, despite their obvious efforts. And nothing in the script was any too commendable, either. ( Granted: the incomparable Edna May Oliver -- notorious for playing the Red Queen in Alice In Wonderland, also released in 1931-actually manages to look good, pulling off her portrayal of a pompous old woman, which is what she's also been bestknown for.) But, aside from that, well ... Yancy Yates isn't popular in town from the first week he arrives, and one of the outlaws decides to shoot Cravat's white hat off as he and his wife ( Irene Dunne) are casually walking by. Despite her anger with the man who fired the bullet, Cravat just takes it completely in stride. Not only was this story not "" shooting for realism "", but it was very lacking in several key areas: e.g., Cravat's newspaper isn't ever really seen. ( Bulletins and posters, yes -- but not any newspaper.) Perhaps strangest of all, though: this is set in a small town in Kansas. Yet, for some reason or other, Yancy Cravat is deadset on calling his paper "" The Oklahoma WigWam. "" Really good westerns have always been very few and far between -- the only exceptions being Clint Eastwood's socalled "" spaghetti westerns "" of the late ' 60s to early ' 70s. Cliche westerns, on the other hand, are a dimeadozen. If you like cliche westerns, "" Cimarron "" will do you proud -- but, as for me ... it did me embarrassment."

1,"17/02/09 "" More "" ( 1969) Dir: Barbet Schroeder   For a film that most viewers have agreed is pretty average, I'm impressed by quite how many differing interpretations have been offered of it. I've only scoured the web quite briefly and I've already been informed that "" More "" is: a 19th Centurystyle romance, an allusion to the story of Icarus, a plain film full of dull people, and of interest only to Pink Floyd completists. It's fair to say, then, that critical reception is mixed. I would argue that these wildly disparate readings of Barbet Schroeder's 1969 directorial debut are proof enough that "" More "" is anything but a pretty average film. Neither is it a masterpiece, of course. I approached "" More "" as I did "" Easy Rider "" and Antonioni's "" Blowup ""as a ' timecapsule ' film, a snapshot of an eradespite the differences in pace, style and content between these movies. They all have similar flawseither vague or downright unlikeable characters, acting that seems slightly adrift from reality, relaxed editing, and abrupt endings that have left viewers indignant. These movies never try to be persuasive or meet the audience half waythey are what they are, man. This in itself is not a problem as long as we are left with a souvenir of the experience. Thankfully, "" More "" offers several truly memorable images, sounds and suggestions to the viewer, and this is what saves it. Stefan is a young man who arrives in Paris fresh from his studies in Germany. The first part of the film follows him as he falls in with a group of French hipsters, accompanies them to devastatingly cool and selfconscious parties and bars before meeting Estelle. The two characters become sexually and romantically involved and he promises to follow her to Ibiza, against the advice of his friend Charlie. This is where the Icarus thing comes into playshe is the Sun, he is pursuing her. You may now be able to guess how this all ends. Ibiza is an idyll so far away from the bustling urgency of the overpopulated Paris that the naive Stefan knows he must be on to a good thing. Estelle remains elusive and erratic, and the island has a less desirable underbelly. Up until now I had cared little for either of these characters and their unfocused pursuit of somewhere to be really free, but once the action is pared down to just these two the film becomes poignant quite suddenly. During just one single wistful exchange of dialogue in the remote villa they inhabit, the place where their volatile love crystallises, I went from watching with a fading optimism to being utterly enraptured. I can't think of many other films that have done this. The relationship between Stefan and Estelle is real and human in that we can see it go from lifedefining intimacy to disillusionment and cruel coldness.

0,"17/02/09 "" More "" ( 1969) Dir: Barbet Schroeder   For a film that most viewers have agreed is pretty average, I'm impressed by quite how many differing interpretations have been offered of it. I've only scoured the web quite briefly and I've already been informed that "" More "" is: a 19th Centurystyle romance, an allusion to the story of Icarus, a plain film full of dull people, and of interest only to Pink Floyd completists. It's fair to say, then, that critical reception is mixed. I would argue that these wildly disparate readings of Barbet Schroeder's 1969 directorial debut are proof enough that "" More "" is anything but a pretty average film. Neither is it a masterpiece, of course. I approached "" More "" as I did "" Easy Rider "" and Antonioni's "" Blowup ""as a ' timecapsule ' film, a snapshot of an eradespite the differences in pace, style and content between these movies. They all have similar flawseither vague or downright unlikeable characters, acting that seems slightly adrift from reality, relaxed editing, and abrupt endings that have left viewers indignant. These movies never try to be persuasive or meet the audience half waythey are what they are, man. This in itself is not a problem as long as we are left with a souvenir of the experience. Thankfully, "" More "" offers several truly memorable images, sounds and suggestions to the viewer, and this is what saves it. Stefan is a young man who arrives in Paris fresh from his studies in Germany. The first part of the film follows him as he falls in with a group of French hipsters, accompanies them to devastatingly cool and selfconscious parties and bars before meeting Estelle. The two characters become sexually and romantically involved and he promises to follow her to Ibiza, against the advice of his friend Charlie. This is where the Icarus thing comes into playshe is the Sun, he is pursuing her. You may now be able to guess how this all ends. Ibiza is an idyll so far away from the bustling urgency of the overpopulated Paris that the naive Stefan knows he must be on to a good thing. Estelle remains elusive and erratic, and the island has a less desirable underbelly. Up until now I had cared little for either of these characters and their unfocused pursuit of somewhere to be really free, but once the action is pared down to just these two the film becomes poignant quite suddenly. During just one single wistful exchange of dialogue in the remote villa they inhabit, the place where their volatile love crystallises, I went from watching with a fading optimism to being utterly enraptured. I can't think of many other films that have done this. The relationship between Stefan and Estelle is real and human in that we can see it go from lifedefining intimacy to disillusionment and cruel coldness. They take a lot of drugs and cavort naked on the terraces, the rocks and beaches. Their lives revolve around nothing but each other and the beautiful Mediterranean surroundings. For a while, their situation is the very essence of freedom, emotional openness and experience for its own sake. But Stefan is not in control, and this is the downfall of more than just his future on Ibiza. Pink Floyd's score is a perfect fit for the exoticism, the intimacy, and the foreboding of "" More "".

It is difficult even to have pity for the poor boy. I think he needs to watch this show, maybe then he might have a chance a saving this marriage. I can't understand how Gretchen stays with him, and I keep wondering how much is just for show, and how much is love. Danny, get a lifea new one that is! ... and don't get me started on Dr. Gary. What is with him and his face? His skin looks like it's stretched to the max. Besides that, looks don't mean a thing, yet he seems not to be particularly impartial.

These people are few confused and each remind me of a dog chasing its tail. sad, very sad. C'mon pull yourselves together."

1,"John Wayne is one of the few players in film history to have failed at his first big break and then succeed on the second time around. Of course everyone knows the second time was the classic Stagecoach with John Ford directing. But we're here to talk about The Big Trail. John Ford's fellow director Raoul Walsh spotted this tall kid on the set of one of Ford's films and thought he had potential. He wanted to make him the lead in a big budget western that Fox was planning to do. The film as planned would be an homage to the famous classic silent western The Covered Wagon. In watching The Big Trail I was struck by how similar Wayne's character of Breck Coleman here is to the Ringo Kid in Stagecoach. Both characters were likable young cowpokes, but both were also on a mission of vengeance. And of course both films were done on location and show the expense in making them. No studio product here with a backlot western set.   I also don't think that it was an accident that Wayne got this break at the beginning of the sound era. Raoul Walsh, I'm guessing looked around Hollywood and probably didn't think a whole lot of movie cowboys would have staying power in sound. That's something else Walsh spotted in Wayne. According to what I've read The Big Trail flopped because after spending all that money to make the film in an early wide screen process, some genius at Fox realized that their theaters weren't equipped with the wide screen to show it. And when the Great Depression hit there would be no money to widen those screens at Fox movie houses. So The Big Trail got a limited release, even in what we would call a formatted version, and lost money big for Fox films. Marguerite Churchill is fine as the crinoline heroine who Duke wins, loses and wins again from Ian Keith. Keith, Charles Stevens and F. Tyrone Power are the trio of villains Wayne has to deal with. F. Tyrone Power is the father of the famous movie legend Tyrone Power. He was a big burly man with a grand background in classic roles on screen and on stage. I wouldn't be surprised if his son who would have been 15 at the time might not have been hanging around the set. Also look for Ward Bond though you might have trouble spotting him under a big bushy beard. Watching The Big Trail now it is interesting to speculate where John Wayne's career might have gone if The Big Trail had been a big hit."

0,"Spike Milligan was one of the funniest men I've ever seen, and a huge influence on my life. This movie is limp and awful, and does his memory no credit. The script is cluttered and preserves too many lines from the book intact ( the leg jokes here are incomprehensible). The actors ' performances are uniformly ineffective, a great cast wasted, and the lead, Sean Hughes, delivers Milligan's belligerent hostilities in a plaintive whine, which misses the point completely. The gentle pacing is a killer as well. Farce should accelerate towards the end. The Goon Shows often did, the novel "" Puckoon "" definitely did, but this film, if anything, slows down just when you want the various elements to smash together in a final climax. Milligan narrated an abridged audio recording of "" Puckoon "" in 1980, with T.P. McKenna, Dermot Kelly, Norma Ronald and Jack Hobbs. Now, that's funny. Ten minutes of that is funnier than this whole film. I believe the LP was transferred to CD, but don't know if it's still in print. There is a movie of "" Adolf Hitler: My Part in his Downfall "" with Jim Dale and Arthur Lowe. It too is a godawful mess, but it's funnier than this thing. It's possible that Milligan's spirit is too rambunctious for the screen. The other reviewers here are indulging in politeness and wishful thinking. This film fumbles virtually every opportunity and never misses a chance to disappoint."

The plot is simple, the baddies have stolen a deadly virus and Guttenburg and the rest of his goodie pals are sent to retrieve it, Not bad of its kind but not in the same league ( obviously) as the films it is compared too on the cover such as AIR FORCE ONE and CON AIR. The cast is good though, with Sean Bean reprising his Brit.-bad guy character which we have had a glimpse of in such box office smashes as GOLDENEYE and PATRIOT GAMES."

0,"A film by Almodovar- sends a tingle down my spine every time. The capitalized print which opens the Spanish auteur's latest feature instantly induces memories of salacious nuns, gentle necrophiliacs, wisecracking transsexuals and I haven't even got as far as the infantterrible's critically reviled early work. And after a beautiful opening montage, with the camera roving across a windswept graveyard animated by a hoard of widows feverishly scrubbing tombstones, I thought Pedro had me again under his wicked spell. Yet once my nostalgia had subsided, there was very little to fill its place. For a director who revels in bringing humanity to assassins and rapists, he does a very poor job at finding any emotional depth or endearing quality in his women. Penelope Cruz is Raimunda, a headstrong housewife whose life is complicated by her daughter's accidental killing of her abusive husband. Thankfully she lives in Almodovar's Spain where your friends will quite happily help to dispose of a corpse for the offer of a round of cocktails. Add to the meltingpot the ghost of Raimunda's mother and a host of other eccentrically warmhearted matriarchs. "" Volver "" means literally to return, and Pedro does appear to be recycling old material. The subplot of incest feels as though it were tackedon as the obligatory "" taboo "". Instead of commenting on or subverting the issue, as with his treatment of paedophilia in Bad Education, it feels forced and unconvincing amid the film's chickflick sentimentality. I suggest Almodovar call his next film Salir ( to move on)."

1,"A group of 7 gold prospectors head into a mine that was recently opened back up after an earthquake. Of course, they don't pay attention to local legend that something is down there and killing people. This low budget ($ 25,000) horror flick has a slight cult following and I'm not exactly sure why ( unless it is because it is so obscure). I'll admit the last half hour is pretty entertaining, but the hour getting there is pure torture. Lots of walking and talking and our titular strangeness doesn't appear until 45 minutes in. Even in the extras cowriter Chris Huntley admits it commits the unforgivable sin of being boring. I would forgive them if they were strict amateurs, but this group graduated from USC so I would hope they know an exploitation film should be exploitive. Anyway, like I said, the last half hour is cool as three survivors battle the stop motion monster and there is a cool John Carpenterlike score. I wanted to see more of the monster, but it is literally on screen for 45 seconds. Even if the movie isn't the best, Code Red DVD has given this great attention. You have interviews and an audio commentary by director Melanie Anne Phillips, producer/ actor Mark Sawicki and cowriter Huntley. The tales about how the film was made are pretty fascinating and inspiring ( like a cave set being built in a backyard). Even more interesting are Sawicki and Huntley's USC student shorts, which are actually all better than the feature production. Huntley was a pretty talented artist and it is a shame he didn't go on to anything else. Sawicki has worked steadily in Hollywood as a visual effects and camera guy. The film's VHS is kind of legendary for how dark it was and I'm sure this is much better. However, you still get scenes where the only image are five helmet lights bouncing around in the blackness. Safe to say, the original MY BLOODY VALENTINE is still "" horror film set in a mine "" champ."

Sadly, too, the screenplay is by the oncegreat experimental novelist John Dos Passos, from an original by French exotic potboiler Pierre Louys. This time Marlene Dietrich is Concha, a manipulative, coldhearted Spanish beauty. Don Pasqual ( Lionel Atwill) raises her from the cigarette factory, but she ditches him. He warns his tall young friend Antonio ( Cesar Romero) against her, but to no avail. A duel ensues, Concha reproaches Pasqualito for trying to kill the only man she ever cared for, so he doesn't: he points his pistol at the sky, but Antonio shoots him. But instead of going off to Paris with the young victor, she goes back to the man who would have died for her. With an unexpected bit by Edward Everett Horton as a Spanish Governor. Dietrich plays the part of a Spanish woman by moving constantly, twisting at the waist and posturing and then twisting back, flouncing, tossing her head, and so forth. And she makes faces, and has a curl in the middle of her forehead. The photography is strangely crowded: no outdoor scene can be shot except through a tangle of bare trees, no interior scene can be shot without so much busy detail that it's almost impossible to follow people moving across a room, no consecutive scene of Dietrich can be shot without a major wardrobe change. The carnival scenes are so full of confetti and streamers it's almost like an underwater scene in the Sargasso Sea."

Although the premise upon which this film is based is almost certainly a biological impossibility and the secret of the plot when revealed at the movie's conclusion makes all which has preceded it faintly ludicrous, the story still serves up some decent entertainment and good acting. Richard Barthelmess has the title role as the sweetnatured Oriental whose life is terribly complicated because he looks Caucasian. Barthelmess keeps the tone of his performance serious throughout, gazing intently into the middle distance ( a mannerism he developed during Silent Days) whenever his character is indecently misused. He makes no attempt to replicate his classic performance in D. W. Griffith's BROKEN BLOSSOMS ( 1919) and this is to his credit. Beautiful Constance Bennett is the millionaire's daughter who makes Barthelmess miserable. She is gorgeous as always, but her behavior does not endear her to the viewer and her terrible illness in the final reel is kept mercifully off screen. Multitalented Frank Albertson has a small role as Barthelmess ' improvident buddy. Serene E. Alyn Warren and blustery Anders Randolf play the leading stars ' very different fathers, while Claude King distinguishes his brief appearance as the English author who befriends Barthelmess. Movie mavens will recognize little Dickie Moore, uncredited, playing Barthelmess as a tiny child. The original Technicolor of the flashback sequence has faded with time to a ruddy tint. The shot purporting to be the South of France instead looks suspiciously like Avalon on Santa Catalina Island, off the coast of Southern California."

Then, as a parody of the Stockholm Syndrome that defines a case when an abducted hostage begins to like and cooperate with the kidnapper, Jodie Foster falls for her abductor too, make love, and both prepare for a getaway. Denis Hopper, the actor, tries to align himself with the creative ambitions of Dennis Hopper, the director. The result is disappointing, and fails to keep pace with the artistic level of a great performer as Dennis Hopper is. There is no real thrill and the script is sometimes naive and predictable. The film is saved to some extent by the performance of Jodie Foster who is not at her best, but still shines with her talent, beauty and gift. Of historical interest is the short appearance of Vincent Price, and, in a small act, of Charlie Sawn known from his great part in "" Wall Street "". If you decide to spend the 116 minutes to see the film, it is not a complete loss; this movie offers easy entertainment, but we would expect much more from the director of "" Easy Rider "", and the actress who gave us the character of Sarah Tobias in "" The Accused ""."

0,"Adored by fans for his unusually charming creativity and by Hollywood for his softball, userfriendly moviemaking techniques, Tim Burton tipped the scales too far in formula's favor with his new upset of a cinematic legend, Sleepy Hollow. Following the quest of Ichabod Crane   played by Johnny Depp, delivering this dreary film's only shining point   to the heart of the mystery surrounding a town's seemingly random and gruesome murders by a fabled headless horseman, the story plays out as if it were purposely trying to be repugnantly predictable. Contrived as a children's bedtime story, humdrum character introduction is laced with intendedupon exciting nonengaging chase scenes which, with undeveloped characters fleeing for their lives, produce about as much fright and thrill as The Nightmare Before Christmas. Toss in an endless bundle of old trees for ambience and a wideeyed, bigbusted blonde love interest ( Christina Reechi) and Burton has himself a movie that takes the ageold legend of Sleepy Hollow and succeeded in making it like a Disney movie without the charm or captivation. Dialog was choppy and ridiculous, severed heads were aplenty, and there were enough plotrevealing monologues to embarrass the likes of James Bond. Even with the backing of Emmanuel Lubezki, the most soughtafter cinematographer in Hollywood today, the wonderful acting of Depp and Burton's astounding namerecognition, Sleepy Hollow is nothing to lose your head over."

0,"After seeing the film version of Heart Of Darkness, I feel as if I wasted 100 minutes of my life. Though the book was not my favorite, I was very disappointed to see how poorly Nicolas Roeg portrayed the story. Despite the fact that he left out many bits of important information, the cast just did not seem to fit their roles and the whole film seemed vastly emotionless. The book depicts vivid scenery and detail that are completely disregarded in the movie.   You'd think a director would be able to fit 76 pages of a book into a film of at least an hour and a half. The differences completely changed the story for me. For example, when the character of Kurtz's fiance is nonchalant to the fact that Kurtz has died, it completely modifies the ending the book had given. Not to mention the sets and scenery used in the film were not nearly as beautiful as they were described. It sincerely feels as if Roeg was filming another story with references from Heart Of Darkness embedded in it.   If you watch the movie without knowing the title or expecting it to be anything like Joseph Conrad's tale, you may find it good. Though I thought the camera work was poor and the cast unfitting, it is a captivating story all the same. However, if you are looking for a good movie version of the famous classic story, don't look for it in Roeg's film."

0,"Although Humphrey Bogart got star billing in King Of The Underworld, I'm willing to bet he didn't thank Jack Warner for it. In fact this film was one hollow crown. King of the Underworld was supposedly a remake of the Paul Muni film, Dr. Socrates, but given Humphrey Bogart was in the cast, the character is written more like Duke Mantee in The Petrified Forest. He even has an English writer along in the person of James Stephenson. Kay Francis and John Eldredge are a pair of married doctors and Eldredge pulls off a tricky bit of surgery on one of Bogart's henchmen. Bogey's a man who appreciates good work done on his behalf and gives Eldredge$ 500.00 and there's more where that came from if he plays his cards right. Eldredge who has a gambling problem sees a good way to get some undeclared income.   But when he's killed in a raid on the gang's hideout, Francis is also thought to be involved by the law and the American Medical Association no matter how much she protests her innocence. It's no good and she and her aunt Jessie Busley move to a small town to get away from the notoriety. Of course the notoriety and Bogart and an itinerant Leslie Howard like writer in Stephenson all meet up with her again. But Kay is plucky and resourceful to say the least. Bogart's character was ridiculous, no wonder the poor guy was screaming for better parts. He's a gangster who both shoots down people without mercy and gives his henchmen hotfoots just for laughs. He's concerned about his image and therefore kidnaps writer Stephenson to ghost write his autobiography and of course confesses enough to burn him in all 48 states. And then let's Kay Francis completely outsmart him, hard to believe he was king of anything. Definitely one of the lesser works for either of the stars."

1,"An Epic Story of Hope constrained by budget and limited artistic ambition. Seeing as Terrence Malick produced this, I expected something haunting and lyrical. Instead, we get a typical Norwegian coproduction ( "" Revolution "" with Al Pacino, anyone?), wherequite possiblygood intentions are scuppered by a dreadful screenplay, and where many of the characters are reduced to stereotypes. The "" meTarzanyouJane "" English dialogue between the nonEnglishspeaking protagonists is particularly cringeworthy   one could speculate whether Nick Nolte and Tim Roth adlibbed their own, as they almost sound like real people. The story is loaded with implausibility: we are expected to believe that Binh can speak a smattering of English after having spent his entire life living as a peasant slave ( his vocabulary, but unfortunately not grammatical command, increases impressively in the Malayan refugee camp, without the benefit of night classes). Coincidence is rife; I wonder whether an hour or two has been edited from the first third: he tracks down his mother in Ho Chi Minh City almost immediatelyafter bumping into his thirty year younger half brother, who nonchalantly recognises him! Mum gives him a gold locket ( or something similar of great value) as they part, but this is never referred to again. His relationship with "" Me Dead Inside "" Ling is supposed to provide the obligatory "" love interest "", but feels as artificial as Leonardo and Cameron in "" Gangs Of New York "".   The voyage in the rust bucket of a boat does convey a sense of the appalling conditions that human trafficking entails. Indeed, the only time the film is remotely exciting and unpredictable, is the jerky, handheld footage shot from the bridge during choppy weather conditions. ( Incidentally, a boat cruise from Malaysia to New York via The Cape Of Good Hope and the African coast, without stopping for fuel or supplies, is certainly an epic journey). The beautiful shot of the New York skyline echoes Malick's use of magic hour, but I want to know why the Coast Guard didn't show up. Perhaps they were watching the Super Bowl, or something. Of course, Binh manages to track down his blind old Dad on a remote farm in Texas, with the same navigational flair he displayed in Ho Chi Minh City. I was impressed at how Nick Nolte could wander around digging fields and feeding horses on a large ranch without the aid of a guide dog or white stick. For demonstration of how a story about the travails befalling refugees could be structured and shot on a small budget, check out Michael Winterbottom's far superior "" In This World ""."

They brought in Olivia NewtonJohn because she is the obvious link between the Broadway production and television audiences. They sang songs from the movie ( "" Hopelessly Devoted, "" et al) because these songs will be included in the new production. I agree with the earlier comment made that the B'Way cast looks so much older, but you must bear in mind that these are people who have been on Broadway and worked their tails off to be there. If the entire cast was green and fresh then I believe that would have compromised the casting process by which producers choose their talent."

1,"As much as I love the story of David Copperfield, I can not claim to have enjoyed this movie. It was probably the second worst movie I have ever seen. One problem I see is that the magnitude of the novel asks for a miniseries of several hours, rather than a regular movie. It is just impossible to capture a significant amount of the events that take place in the story in two hours. I dis not enjoy the brooding flashback format. It was disjointed and would be impossible for someone who did not already know the story to fully grasp. Also, I don't think the filmmakers interpreted Copperfield's personality correctly. The idea of him strolling around on a beach moaning about his life seems inconsistent with the proactive, forwardthinking nature Dickens gave him in the novel. Agnes also bothered me. She came across as a ditsy household decoration, rather than a strong woman. Dora was perfect, however. This movie was fraught with problems, and I wait eagerly for someone to make a decent screen version."

There is some hint of rediscovery but the movie gives nor explanation nor a real ending. Daniel reactions after the abuse are very basic. He quits dancing, has sex with every women around and finally starting a relation with very simple and common woman. I have seen a good share of arthouse movies but this has something missing in it. The main leads are fine; but some characters does not seems to be completely defined."
0,"Chuck Jones's ' Odorable Kitty ' is the cartoon that introduced Pepe Le Pew to the world   sort of. There are a few key differences between the Pepe we know and love ( or hate, in the case of some people) and the character in this cartoon. For one, the disguised cat who Pepe amorously pursues in ' Odorable Kitty ' is distinctly male. Also, Pepe is exposed as a fraud whose real name is Henry at the cartoon's climax, his French accent dropping away when his wife and family turn up. Pepe is not even the lead character here, the focus favouring the putupon cat who disguises himself as a skunk to scare off his enemies. For the most part, the storyline largely follows the usual format of a Pepe Le Pew cartoon but Pepe's aggressive courtship is lacking the usual wisecracks and straight to camera addresses that make him such a great character. He is also not nearly as handsome as he would become and rather awkwardly animated. In fact, ' Odorable Kitty ' is a fairly ugly and clumsy looking cartoon all round. Its main source of appeal comes from its concept which was original at this stage before it became the template for every Pepe Le Pew cartoon that followed. This subsequent development has robbed ' Odorable Kitty ' of any impact whatsoever and to modern viewers it just looks like a rather dull Pepe Le Pew short with a weird surprise ending. As a child, I hated Pepe Le Pew. As an adult, able to appreciate his more sophisticated, verbal and risqu humour, I love the character and most of his cartoons. ' Odorable Kitty ' makes me feel like a child again!"

0,"Curse of Michael Myers is a very frustrating piece to deal with for a fan of the Halloween series. After a very disappointing letdown in Halloween 5, the series reached a near ebb in plot lines, with a silly devolution into witchcraft and a teenage cult dedicated to the worship of Michael Myers. "" Curse of Michael Myers "" ups the ante in blood and gore, but really represents a decay in the series ' integrity. It's too bad to, as this is the last movie for Donald Pleasance as the character of Dr. Loomis. Pleasance has some good screen moments ( precious ones if your a fan of the series) as the now very aged and as he says "" very retired doctor "". Sadly he died before the movie was completed, and it is very apparent at the conclusion of the film that the stories original climatic scene was never realized. Right from the beginning credits, Halloween 6 has more of the feel of a madeforTV movie then that of the blockbuster horror flick that it started out as in 1978. Any loyal Halloween alumni should have demanded more from this film, ... Dr. Loomis and Donald Pleasance deserved more."

Well, parts of the Earth, because somewhere in Italy, a band of purebred survivors -- those without radioactive contamination -- are holed up in a massive mansion surrounded by lush grounds, waiting for the next opportunity to go hunting for those with polluted blood. The Final Executioner is the story of one of their would be victims, Alan ( William Mang, who looks, not surprisingly, a lot like Kurt Russell), and his efforts to take down the legally sanctioned hunters, who are led by Edra ( Marina Costa) and Erasmus ( Harrison Muller Jr.). Alan has been trained to kill by former NYPD cop Sam ( Woody Strode) who mostly hangs around giving his pupil moral support and mooching for tinned meat. Strode is by far the best thing about the film, though he doesn't look at all well and only appears for about a third of the running time. As for the story, it's a blending of elements from better films and stories, including Ten Little Indians, The Most Dangerous Game, and Escape From New York. The Final Executioner moves along at a fair pace and provides reasonable entertainment for less discriminate action fans."

1,"Even though he only made his debut film in Australia and left for Great Britain and then America to continue his career, Australians will tell you that the greatest film star they ever produced was Errol Flynn. I'm not sure he ever even went back to Australia after his breakout success in Captain Blood. Still I attribute this film to the well known Aussie irreverence for trashing the reputation of one of their own. Part of the problem in telling Errol Flynn's life story was that he told enough tall tales in his life right up to the very end in his memoir, My Wicked Wicked Ways. I could see that a lot of the film was based on that and upon reading between the lines of that book. His mother's infidelity to his father was not written, but could have been inferred in reading My Wicked Wicked Ways. He didn't particularly like the woman, that is clear from a few sources.   I wish the film had dealt more with his New Guinea adventures, that to me was the most interesting part of My Wicked Wicked Ways. As for his street fighting in the Depression, I tend to disbelieve that. Even if he had been successful at it, I guarantee that enough of that would have ruined his looks and he would never have had a career as a leading man. Still the folks down under seem to think the atmosphere of Sydney during the Depression was captured well and Guy Pearce is a charismatic Errol Flynn. American audiences know him best as the uptight, but honest Lieutenant Exley in LA Confidential which came out the same year as Flynn. But LA Confidential was a far better film."

0,"First off, if you want to make a good film, don't cram all your exposition into the last 10 minutes. The viewer is expected to be bewildered for nearly two hours, only to have Margo's father explain everything to Alex very late in the film. To make matters worse, the scriptwriter decided it wasn't enough to have the basic mystery solved, but adds in a completely unnecessary murder that we knew nothing about ( involving Alex's father!). There's some serious motivation issues with characters also. Margo's father's choices don't seem to make sense once the film is over. Why didn't he just kill Philippe's father and be done with it? Instead, a complicated plot to obscure the truth is concocted, but one which ensures that everyone will be in physical jeopardy for years ( including the completely innocent photographer, who gets murdered by Philippe's father's thugs). Although Alex is a doctor ( whom one would think is relatively bright), he chooses to flee the police, during which he not only endangers his own life, but those whom he involves in a nasty pileup on the freeway. Why was Margo's friend so keen on keeping her promise to Margo, once all the crap hits the fan for Alex? And are we to think that Margo's father would rather kill himself rather than go to prison? What about his wife? Did he consider her wishes? Those are some of the main problems. Then there are some nasty details, like: why was her father there the night of her faked death? How did he get a hold of the junkie's body on such short notice and get it back quickly in order to bury it with the other two? Alex's friend Bruno seems overeager to be part of the mayhem, in which he and his friends have to kill for Alex, notwithstanding the perceived debt he owes Alex for saving his son's life. What good would the photos of Margo do? They don't implicate Philippe at all. And why would Margo have the safety deposit box key handy that night for her wouldbe abductors to take? Did I miss some other things? Probably. Minor irritations of mine include the fact that although Alex is a doctor, he smokes like a fiend. Which makes his marathon run away from the police even that more impressive. Also, when he is riding in the convertible with his lawyer, neither of them is wearing a seat belt.

At times reminding me of the humor of Jackson's Dead Alive and others of a Stuart Gordon flick this little find should have most chuckling throughout.   The f/ x reach a few highs of truly spooky ( the first time Ed meets his nemesis) but generally have the feel that this film was put together by a f/ x team that decided to use any and all props at their disposal from other films ... gremlins, devils, slasher films, etc. to pretty good effect and worked in thru the use of hallucinations.   The gem of the film is the humor. The gore works most of the time but more for laughs. At its heart its a parody and a fun one at that."

I was gladly surprised when I figured out that contrary to what we usually see, computerperformed actions are somehow realistic, as they use Windows 3.x and normal computers. The storytelling is median and not bothering the viewer. The end is typically American.

What actually happened though was that Jason Palmer did the original makeup for the Sasquatch, but for some reason they had to go back and reshoot much of the creature. The sad part was that Jason passed away a few weeks before that and so the redone creature was no where near as awesome as the original one.

0,"Hilariously ineptlike "" She Wore A Yellow Ribbon "" remade by fiveyearolds. Spoilers ahead: Despite its title, and the high bodycount, "" Slaughter Trail "" is in fact a musical with Injun battles instead of dance numbers. If you ever wondered what Ed Wood might have done with a Bmovie budget, this film should answer your question. Some decisions may have been bad only in retrospect, such as filming in the shortlived Cinecolor process, which resulted in faces changing hue within the same shot. But there was definitely some illadvised skimping on the film's main set, a cavalry fort that seems to be partly a Norman castle. Terry Gilkyson, who later wrote the ' The Bare Necessities ' for Disney's "" The Jungle Book "", supplies a score full of original ditties which would have been wonderful for a cartoon but which fit Western action like a fuzzy slipper stuck in a stirrup. One song tells how "" horse hooves pound, and their melody sounds, like the hoofbeat serenade"" ... during a deadserious scene of a cavalry patrol. Other songs literally narrate the story shot by shot, introducing characters, describing their moods and gesturesas they happen on screenand even stop to advertise the Cinecolor process (!)   The script sends ferocious Navajos on the warpath to avenge the killing of two of their band by an outlaw trio.

""   And lest anyone forget just what a nasty piece of work Howard Hughes could be, recall that as head of RKO, Hughes was first in line to blacklist original star Howard Da Silva when HUAC denounced him. It would take Hughes another six years to finish running that oncecelebrated studio into the ground, but it didn't help things when he insisted on reshooting Da Silva's every scene for this film, substituting Donlevy.

1,"Hilariously ineptlike "" She Wore A Yellow Ribbon "" remade by fiveyearolds. Spoilers ahead: Despite its title, and the high bodycount, "" Slaughter Trail "" is in fact a musical with Injun battles instead of dance numbers. If you ever wondered what Ed Wood might have done with a Bmovie budget, this film should answer your question. Some decisions may have been bad only in retrospect, such as filming in the shortlived Cinecolor process, which resulted in faces changing hue within the same shot. But there was definitely some illadvised skimping on the film's main set, a cavalry fort that seems to be partly a Norman castle. Terry Gilkyson, who later wrote the ' The Bare Necessities ' for Disney's "" The Jungle Book "", supplies a score full of original ditties which would have been wonderful for a cartoon but which fit Western action like a fuzzy slipper stuck in a stirrup. One song tells how "" horse hooves pound, and their melody sounds, like the hoofbeat serenade"" ... during a deadserious scene of a cavalry patrol. Other songs literally narrate the story shot by shot, introducing characters, describing their moods and gesturesas they happen on screenand even stop to advertise the Cinecolor process (!)   The script sends ferocious Navajos on the warpath to avenge the killing of two of their band by an outlaw trio.

1,"I absolutely love standup comedy. I love to hear the raw thoughts of the standup on stage, as they are appealing to an audience of their peers different life experiences they have had, or things they have thought up or seen that they just thought were so**** ing stupid that they had to share it with someone.   There used to be standups who took on a persona that everyone could relate to ( Rodney Dangerfield comes to mind) or were just so damn crazy that you couldn't help but laugh with them as they laughed at others ( Richard Pryor). And then, there were the thoughtprovoking comics like George Carlin, who, despite pretending to be a loon, was the smartest guy in the room, who appealed to people to rethink things they saw when they walked around, and realize just how screwed up things were, and how easily they could change things. Now, this might seem to not have anything to do with "" Mind Of Mencia, "" which, as I agree with most commentators here, is Comedy Central's horrid solution to the loss of "" Chappelle's Show, "" but it does. Carlos Mencia spends half of the show doing standup bits for his audience, sometimes on popular topics, most of the time on just racism and racial stereotypes. He tries to be all three of the above types of standups. He makes a stage character, an everyday Mexican named Carlos who, despite stereotypes, is just your runofthemill normal guy. He then proceeds to try to laugh at others, people he calls racist or just those that disagree with his opinion. And then, finally, he presents skits to the studio audience and the viewer, telling them that it will help them see his point of view. Carlos Mencia always says he's showing a point of view that people don't see, yet what he is really doing is not only promoting racist stereotypes that already exist and have been joked about to death, but he stupidly encourages people to hear them and do the one thing that helps keep them around: laugh. Promoting stereotypes is usually the lowest, yet easiest, way to get laughs in standup. The best comedians, which, I fear, Carlos Mencia feels he is in good company with, don't have to resort to them. They talk universally, and ask you to laugh AT absurdity, rather than with it, like Mencia encourages. As he creates more skits or "" reallife "" situations that call for racism or the bashing of others with the use of it, he tells us, rather than asks us, to laugh, and actually presents these absurdities as truth, rather than just extremes of it.   His show is an insult to the minds of those who watch it. Mencia doesn't give us comedy and ask us to digest it and take from it what we want ( something that, as much as I hate to compare the two, was "" Chappelle's Show's "" finest quality) he tells us exactly how we should view it and react to it --- which, according to him, is to make a stupid face and say "" Dee Dee Dee! "" This show is appropriately named. It is indeed a show about "" The Mind of Mencia. "" It's Mencia's mind, through and through, and, as such, is nothing more than dumb entertainment. The show is tailormade to give life lessons to its core audience, 1424 year olds, about how stereotypes are bad, but that racial bashing is alright to Carlos Mencia, and therefore should be alright to you!"

1,"I am sure I'm in the minority ( I know I am among my friends), but I found this movie long, boring and gratuitous. The fact that the role played by DENIS LEARY is the most likable character ( the only other time I liked him at all was in "" A Bug's Life ""!) speaks volumes. Rene Russo's character was irritating beyond belief and Thomas Crowne himself was flat and stereotypical. To say he was twodimensional may be a little generous. ( No, the scenes with his psychiatrist did NOT help make him real.) With the exception of two wonderful scenes ( both involving the museum caper and NOT involving Rene Russo), this movie made me wish I were at home watching televised golf."

0,"I am surprised that so many comments about this film are positive. Having read the book several times ( and all the other historical novels by Mika Waltari) there is no way to say much good in this film. If I forget the origins of the story I might consider it a reasonably good epic. Of course to bring such a brick of a book to the big screen is a task not to be envied, but it could be done with class. I can't understand why even the name of Nefernefernefer had to be shortened to just Nefer. I love Peter Ustinov as Kaptah and Marlon Brando probably would have made a better Sinuhe but the overall attitude is too Hollywood to ever make justice to the book. Mind you Mika Waltari left the Premier of this film in the middle of the showing. That's how much he liked it."

0,"I can hardly call this a great film but it is entertaining. In my case I, at the time this film was released, was the same age as some of the junior campers in the film. For me watching this film brings back the memories of my camp years. While some of the pranks that takes place in this movie, like carrying the camp director out in his bed and leaving him on the side of a road, strung up in the trees or out on a lake, are a bit over the top some of the other pranks are not. When I went to camp the campers and counselors pulled similar stunts such as running underwear up the flag pole, canoe battles and boys raiding the girls cabin. As I grew older I realized these night raids to the girls cabin that I participated in were carefully orchestrated by the counselors so that we wouldn't find the girls in embarrassing situations but at the time I thought it was real and it was fun. That's what MEATBALLS ( MB) is.   MB captures not only the scenic beauty of camp surroundings but the beauty of being young and carefree. MB give a great example of preteens, teens and young adults living their summer with no concerns other than guys hooking up with girls and girls hooking up with guys and booth having as much fun as they can before they head back to junior high & high school and college. The opening title song that goes "" Are you ready for the summer? ... no more homework no more books, no more teachers dirty looks ... "" describes exactly how summer is viewed by school kids.   I personally enjoyed the two campers Spaz and Fink. What boy, nerd or jock, didn't spend all camp trying to cozy up to some pretty girl camper? What guy didn't want to be accepted by the other campers and counselors? While these two characters are somewhat over the top I bet everybody who watches the film can't help but to like these two guys. These two characters are a mix of Charlie Brown from PEANUTS and Jack Tripper & Larry Dallas from THREE 'S COMPANY. I would bet that most viewers even cheer for Spaz in the egg carrying competition and for Fink as he attempts to "" beat the stomach "" in the hot dog eating contest.   Lastly, this movie had normal looking kids and counselors. No super models for counselors or campers that wore trendy clothing. It is fun to just kick back and watch this film and remember when life was as fun as this movie."

1,"I can understand why others reacted rather unpleasantly towards the climax yielding a twist that really is hard to take seriously. I think, though, that the buildup to it works rather well. The music, quite menacing and spinetingling, really provides a spooky aura matching the unforgiving sound of a constant ringing telephone that is driving struggling English actress, Joan Matlin(Jean Marsh)bonkers. She's borrowing a pal's nice apartment while attempting to jumpstart her career in New York City( .. the city buildings outside the window look about as realistic as David Letterman's)and is unceremoniously welcome by a noisy telephone which rings quite a bit, followed by loud slams against the wall. Searching for answers regarding the one responsible for such disregard towards her sanity, Joan discovers that no one rents that room, and that a former tenant had in fact strangled herself. Without help from the manager, Joan will decide to find out for herself who is causing her such anguish. Joan discovers the room empty and the phone with a particular female voice which will haunt her. The episode, I think, is a tourdeforce for Jean Marsh who is a one woman show. She's the only actress visible and we follow her through the crisis which slowly erodes her, the phone and the banging from that other room causing her much distress which grows into fear. Instead of leaving, Joan remains, so shaken by the noise and to the breaking point where she just wishes for the phone( .. or whoever is ringing)to stop. The episode provides a possible answer as to who is plaguing Joan and why. A character named Beth comes into the story rather late as Joan struggles to find out whose female voice it was across the other line who knew her name on that dreaded phone she discovers in the room across from hers. The fate of Beth might just tell the viewer why Joan is being traumatized. I think this episode is an exercise in spooks instead of credibility;some didn't particularly like it, but I certainly did. I will admit that the phone, as a physical menace "" crawling "" towards Joan is hard to take seriously, not to mention it's attack on her, but I thought the intense opening twenty minutes before this were suitably chilling enough to make up for it."

0,"I d been interested in watching this ever since it was cited as the Worst Film Ever on an entry devoted to 1950s scifi cinema in a British periodical from the early 1980s entitled The Movie ( incidentally, the Leonard Maltin Film Guide also awarded this the unenviable BOMB rating). When it came out on DVD last year, I became interested in purchasing the Cult Camp Classics Box Set in which it was included ( along with QUEEN OF OUTER SPACE [ 1958 ] and THE GIANT BEHEMOTH [ 1959 ]); however, since recently acquiring QUEEN on DVDR, I had put paid to the idea. Happily, I ve just stumbled upon the film on DivX   however, the print was nt culled from the Warners DVD ( which is said to boast a surprisingly pleasantlooking transfer) but rather a muddy TV printthough not so much that the detail is lost ( in other words, it was like watching the film in sepia as opposed to blackandwhite!). Anyway, to get to the matter at hand: I have to admit that, in a way, I was disappointed the film did nt prove to be the laughfest I had anticipated all this time ( Maltin calls it hilariously awful); actually, I found it quite engaging   and thankfully brief at a little over an hour in length. Some undeniably amusing bits remain though   such as when the old nurse starts screaming her head off at the sight of the 50-foot woman, and when the Sheriffs deputy almost runs over his chief and the leading ladys butler in his enthusiasm to be of assistance in such an unusual case. Neither did the special effects hit me as being among the funniest ( Maltin again) on film   though they re certainly embarrassingly bad!   O.K., so the idea that an alien ( in giantsized human form, clad in caveman rags, and radioactive to boot!) coming to Earth in a big ballshaped (!) spaceship and apparently after the heroines prized necklace is utter nonsense   and his quasitransparent appearance does it no favors at allbut, really, its the human story that holds our attention ( relatively speaking). The character of the philandering husband is nt very interesting, but his two women are: wealthy but nagging alcoholic wife Allison Hayes and ambitious, vixenish girlfriend Yvette Vickers. Also involved in the narrative are Hayes faithful servant ( already mentioned), a couple of cops ( one of them, as noted elsewhere, being amiably goofy) and as many doctors ( one of whom is named Dr. Cushing [! ] and another a specialist who s called in when Hayes starts growing in size after being exposed to radiation). Of course, the film could be seen as the reversed female version of THE INCREDIBLE SHRINKING MAN ( 1957)   though it would nt be fair to compare the two further, as the Jack Arnold/ Richard Matheson classic is far more psychological/ intellectual in approach; actually, Hayes does nt seem to be that bothered with her condition and, in fact, takes advantage of it in order to teach her husband a lesson! However, her rampage   exaggerated in movie posters of the era   is rather quaint ( especially when considering that it only occurs in the last ten minutes or so); when not shown the damage caused by her enormous but highly unconvincing hand ( especially when lifting the puppet that s supposed to be her husband!), she s mostly seen walking in long shot and almost from behind ( with her size even inconsistent in proportion to the buildings she passes by)!! Still, Hayes demise via electrocution ( when she bumps into an electrical cable) is competently done. Finally, I followed this with its 1993 TV remake with Daryl Hannah as the titular creature   which I rented specifically for this purpose."

0,"I did not think Haggard was the funniest movie of all time I like CKY and Viva La Bam a lot more. I think a lot of it was just really stupid and had no plot for being a movie. I highly recommend not paying a lot of money for this movie but anyone who likes viva la bam, CKY, or Jack Ass should see it. I loved many parts of the movie and then there were parts that should have been cut out. I think that Jonny Knoxville should have played in the movie because he is a much better actor then most of the people from Haggard and probably could have made this movie allot more funnier. I think Ryan Dunn was probably the best actor and it should have had bam skating more."

1,"I disagree 100% with the reviewer who disagreed 100% with the reviewer who gave this short movie an "" F "" grade. Cashing in heavily on political propaganda only obscures Joe Dante's lack of ability to pull another Howling out of his bag of tricks. The Masters of Horror series was a phenomenal collection of truly horrifying tales, save for this episode. Despite gaining acclaim from those who wish to promote it's political slant, "" Homecoming "" is the least effective episode of MOH season one. Unlike the rest of the series, Dante's entry is a parody of the genre, falling short of both horror and humor in it's hamfisted delivery of a hackneyed political point. Dante can really only be blamed for pulling this stinker off the shelf, as it wasn't his creation. The zombie subgenre is very popular this decade, and among the crop of predictable George Romero tributes and vacuous fantasies are a number of works designed to push political or ( ir)religeous messages. Such works are not written by or intended for true horror fans. Maybe Dante really isn't a a Master of Horror, either. What has he been up to since The Howling, after all? If you want a lame antiwar zombie flick with a few pop culture references passed off as humor, Homecoming may be just your thing. If you are a horror fan looking for something Masterful, pick up ... most any other episode of the series.

Cashing in heavily on political propaganda only obscures Joe Dante's lack of ability to pull another Howling out of his bag of tricks. The Masters of Horror series was a phenomenal collection of truly horrifying tales, save for this episode. Despite gaining acclaim from those who wish to promote it's political slant, "" Homecoming "" is the least effective episode of MOH season one. Unlike the rest of the series, Dante's entry is a parody of the genre, falling short of both horror and humor in it's hamfisted delivery of a hackneyed political point. Dante can really only be blamed for pulling this stinker off the shelf, as it wasn't his creation. The zombie subgenre is very popular this decade, and among the crop of predictable George Romero tributes and vacuous fantasies are a number of works designed to push political or ( ir)religeous messages. Such works are not written by or intended for true horror fans. Maybe Dante really isn't a a Master of Horror, either. What has he been up to since The Howling, after all? If you want a lame antiwar zombie flick with a few pop culture references passed off as humor, Homecoming may be just your thing. If you are a horror fan looking for something Masterful, pick up ... most any other episode of the series. My personal favorite was Dario Argento's "" Jenifer, "" based loosely on a classic comic short by the team of Bruce Jones and Berni Wrightson -- truly creepy."

It was a really clasic due, it was funny cause abbott and costello were always the same characters, but it was sooo funny, now what i like about jack and the beanstalk is that even though the love story is totally boring and that one song the prince sings, omg, awefull, but i like the angle they took on the love, story, the couple has to get married cause one kingdom is running out of money, they meet in the jail cell and fall in love becaue they both pretend not to be royal and they end up being the couple, so happy ending, i do nt think that was the orginal version, if it was they should have cut it out of this movie, but i think it was orginal and i love it. but watching it sucks, lol, also when the movie really kicks in with the giant + abbott and costello it is sooooo funny. when the giant is beating jack into the door and jack is screaming "" OPEN THE DOOR, OPEN THE DOOR "" that stuff is really funny. And that once joke where jack starts screaming prince, prince and all those dogs jump him. kinda cheezy but really orginal. i wish they would have al least tried to remaster it, though i got that africa screamsjack and the beanstalk, and i do nt mind the quality cause when i had it on tape it was bad quality also so whatever i guess. the begining is mildly funny the middle is really really funny, and the end is not funny in the least, but i am 19 years old and when a movie made in 52 makes me laugh this hard, it rocks, this movie is really funny. i love their style. also the chapters suck. also the part where jack is climbing the beanstalk and they are all singing a song about what a dipstick jack is and that he will be killed, that s pretty funny"

0,"I guess it wasn't entirely the filmmaker's fault though. The film suffered from the unimaginably stupid decision to tell Clayton Moore ( who had done the role in the 1950's and was the Lone Ranger us old folks grew up with) he couldn't wear the mask in public. Now mind you, the poor guy wasn't making all that much money doing so, and it wasn't like he was going to take anything away from this film, but the whole thing seemed ... gratuitous. The other thing the film suffered from ( besides a leading man whose voice was so awful they had to overdub it) was that fact that Westerns weren't so hip in 1981. John Wayne was dead and we had just been subjected to a decadelong major liberal guilt trip about how the west was built on genocide of the Native Americans. ( That and Blazing Saddles sent up the whole genre! The Campfire scene. Enough said!) Hollywood shied away from Westerns, because Science Fiction was COOL then. The one scene that underscored it was when after rescuing the drunken President Grant ( and seriously, I'd have let Grant stay with the bad guys. The country would have been better off!) Grant asks Tonto what his reward should be "" Honor your treaties with my people "". Yeah, right, like THAT was going to happen!"

The film revolves around impersonation ( which seems to be in the curriculum of every comic star!)in this case a German officerand, while not as bad as Leonard Maltin claims ( awarding it a BOMB rating), it's not exactly classic stuff eithercertainly leagues behind Chaplin's THE GREAT DICTATOR ( 1940), even if comparably narcissistic! Ironically, the scenes prior to the appearance of the wouldbe wacky General offer more felicities than the rather forced humor at Nazi expense!   The film was really Lewis ' last gasp during his heyday; in fact, this proved to be his last vehicle to be released for 10 years ( it's painfully apparent here that his particular brand of foolishness wouldn't pass muster in the age of Mel Brooks and Woody Allen)!"

I saw The Clearing on DVD but if I had seen it in the movies I would have had to stand up and SCREAM "" HE 'S NOT DEAD YET, YOU MORON! "" The Clearing is another in a long list of horrible movies that feature Mr. Redford. Legal Eagles, Havana, Indecent Proposal, Up Close and Personal, Sneakers, Last Castle, and Spy Game. If Robert Redford told me to invest in something I'd go the other way.   But the worst possible thing you can do to an audience is this. Say you're being kidnapped and your kidnapper has a gun. He's holding it on you for most of the movie. You turn the tables on him and start strangling him. Whatever you do keep strangling him until he's DEAD! Don't just strangle him for ten seconds. Stay with it! Ten minutes at least. But Bob stops too soon, walks away and forgets about Mr. Kidnapper until ....... He gets up, finds the gun and holds it on our hero again. At this point I wanted Mr. Kidnapper to shoot Robert Redford. More than a few times. And I wanted to shoot him as well."

1,"I pretty much liked every character on this show from the start except Reba herself. She comes off as an holier than thou type and quite frankly a big Bully. And that stinks because she is in every scene and every episode. In the later seasons Van becomes unlikeable too, like a spoof of his former self. and Kyra walks around sneering and being miserable. The first 3 to 4 seasons are pretty good if you overlook Reba. Towards the end its pretty bleak .. In basically every episode Barbara jean Is walking around being dumb, Reba is being mean to her, but poor Ole Barbara jean desperately wants Reba to like her which results in Barabara jean telling Reba how awesome she is in every episode. I think it is pretty clear to see Reba has self esteem issues and wants to be seen as this all forgiving saint. Its really a shame too because other than her the show had such potential."

1,"I rarely give ratings less than 5, but in this instance I must weigh in. Elmore Leonard is a great writer with many wonderful, complex books, original characters, crisp dialogue, invigorating plot twists. Films based on his books go way back to Hombre ( Paul Newman), Mr. Majestyk ( Bronson), and Out of Sight ( Clooney/ Lopez) among others. Even when done soso the films at least have some measure of story essence coming through. This one, .... it is simply not a worthy addition to the catalog. The acting is bad ( I do not know why, because these are very capable people here) and the story is handled with stupidity. The characters are rearranged, the chemistry is missing, the actors and actresses are miscast. Since Elmore Leonard is a really great story teller, I would hope that anyone who does not know his work would be dissuaded from reading his books because they saw this disappointing rendition of one of his stories. The story is a sequel to Get Shorty. If you have not seen that film, do not watch this. If you have seen Get Shorty, do not proceed to this. I saw Be Cool a few years back, and tonight have been revisiting the vid. The first time must not have made such a negative impression because I had forgotten how dismal this sequel was. Fortunately, I think no less of those who appeared in this film for having done so. They probably expected something more. Get Shorty was original and great fun. Travolta I nearly always like, but he is so much better in Tarantino's Pulp Fiction and in the preceding Get Shorty. He was clearly unable to enjoy whatever was going on here. And I hear Freaky Deaky, another Elmore Leonard book, is in preproduction for 2008 release. Hopefully they can pull it off. Read the books. They are almost all great."

This movie is awful from the DeMille version. All the way through this movie I was saying to myself, Huh???What????I don't remember that part. The only exciting thing in this movie so far was the parting of the Red Sea. And in Heston's versionit was a heck of a lot better than this version. Did anyone else see an atomic or nuclear bomb cloud fade in and out when the Red Sea was being parted? I think I did. Anyway, I MightMightwatch the last part tonight. I wish Hollywood would tackle different ideas and subject matters when they are making new movies. Instead of rehashing old films. They should of left well enough alone. UPDATE: Well I watched the last part. Did Moses make up the second copy of the ten commandments with his own handor was I seeing thingsplease someoneemail me and let me know. HORRIBLE"

0,"I remember watching Police Squad! when it first came on ABC in 1982 and I thought it was a very funny show, thanks to the many sight gags, non sequitors and scripts filled with word play. In one episode, there was a line where a man named Once was shot twice.   But unfortunately, ABC canceled the show after only six episodes. I felt it deserved a much longer run but a network executive thought the show demanded too much attention of the viewer because of all the sight gags in each episode. One that I remember was in the opening where the episode's title was different from the one shown on the screen.   Leslie Nielsen's portrayal of Frank Drebin was deadpan, yet very funny and his role was in the narrative style of Jack Webb of Dragnet. Alan North did well and Peter Lupus, in one of his few roles since Mission: Impossible wasn't bad as Norberg, But the one character that stood out was Johnny the Shoeshine Boy, played by William Duell. After giving advice to Drebin, there were cameos from Dick Clark, Dr. Joyce Brothers and then Dodger manager Tommy LaSorda.   Even though Police Squad! had a short life on ABC, the Zucker Brothers didn't give up on the concept which turned out even more successful in the Naked Gun movie franchise. I'll close with a regular closing gag. Freeze the ending right here."

Lots of blood from the street fights, although the cheap sound effects for the punches took something away from it. And lots of sex. I remember one of the early scenes when Bogard meets this pretty brunette in an apartment she is showing him. Without saying a word, he picks her up, puts her in the windowsill and nails her. From what I remember the picture sailed from that point on. So, when I found out Bogart is also called Black Fist and was available on VHS, I ordered it online. I was very disappointed. Black Fist is Bogard edited for television. So many of the scenes I remember were missing, I wondered if indeed, this was the same picture."

0,"I saw the movie in original Italian. It must be said that the acting and interpretation is most heavily polluted by the TVgenerated trend to speak in a severely muffled voice, not moving lips, straining tones, as emerged in the "" That's real life""-productions and "" Let'sraiseour audiencewithafewtears""-screenplaywriting. The late Massimo Girotti towers upon the other characters for intensity, clarity of expression and intellectual honesty. The movie has some good hints, but ( as in another comment before mine) it lacks a focal point and dribbles away in many plotlets of lesser and lesser relevance, another trend dragged in from the TV productions, well known to Italians. A few drops in style could be spared to the public, such as the patisserie drag ( Charm and aesthetics of cooking plus sensual payload of sweets, see Chocolat, Babette's lunch, Vatel etc.) Hammam and the Fairies are definitely more truthful, seems that Ozpetek has learned the tune of Italy in the early 2000s and is humming along ...

Alice's first encounter is being bathed, with emphasis on the genitals and bottom. Her next encounter is an oral one with the Mad Hatter's dingaling. I forget the rest of the lecture and the order of Alice's encounters, but I do remember how well they matched. It's interesting to see a skin flick with some brains behind it, rather than the cliche "" I'm here to deliver your pizza. Let's screw. "" I don't see how Kristin DeBell's career could be wrecked by this film, as it was her first film.

Reisner was obsessed with images she perceived as child pornography. She saw the "" Alice "" cover Ms DeBell did for Playboy and promptly announced she had scientifically proven that Ms DeBell was in fact a photo collage of parts from several grown women and the face of a ten year old.

0,"I thought Choke had potential, but I thought it could have been a much better film. It had some interesting twists and turns, but some of them seemed kind of pointless. When showing background on the two main characters, some of that really seemed to go awry. Most of it was sort of useless and didn't help the movie at all. This was also not Dennis Hopper's finest hour. However, the main saving grace of this movie for me was Michael Madsen. His performance was excellent. In this movie, he almost makes Mr. Blonde look like a nice guy. All in all, it was watchable. Still, I was left thinking some things could have been done differently. These things would have made the movie much better, in my opinion."

Not a truly great movie -- too predictable -- but certainly better than advertised.

Obviously Lawrence had a profound experience that opened up his mind, and I guess he wants to share this with others but this was neither the time nor the place. This whole experience seemed like a motivational speech in hell, it really did. I believe the catch phrase of the night was "" ride it until the wheels fall off "" which he intermingled with just plain lewd jokes revolving around sex and sexual organs. Don't get me wrong, I don't mind crude humor, but Lawrence lacks the gift of classing it up in the fashion of Eddie Murphy, Richard Prior or Robin Williams. Lawrence was just plain lewd, the only time I laughed was when he relived his experience with the law and his recovery in the hospital. If there were minus points, i would give them ...."
1,"I usually really like Lawrence and being in Australia I haven't seen much of his stand up, so when I saw this at my video shop I thought, yeah I'll have a look. I wish I hadn't seen it now. Obviously Lawrence had a profound experience that opened up his mind, and I guess he wants to share this with others but this was neither the time nor the place. This whole experience seemed like a motivational speech in hell, it really did. I believe the catch phrase of the night was "" ride it until the wheels fall off "" which he intermingled with just plain lewd jokes revolving around sex and sexual organs. Don't get me wrong, I don't mind crude humor, but Lawrence lacks the gift of classing it up in the fashion of Eddie Murphy, Richard Prior or Robin Williams. Lawrence was just plain lewd, the only time I laughed was when he relived his experience with the law and his recovery in the hospital. If there were minus points, i would give them ...."
1,"I was a bit surprised to see all of the hate comments on here. Sure it's not the best kid's show, but don't people stop despising Barney this much after the fifth grade? Okay, everyone hates Barney. Okay, I think his voice and songs are annoying. Okay, he's kinda creepy and strange. I'm fourteen years old, so I know well enough. But here's the thing. Kids? They LOVE this show. When I was a little kiddie of two or three, my parents spent more time chasing me around the house than they did anything else. Nothing could hold my attention for more than ten minutes. Face it, that's how toddlers are. Even the most patient ones can't sit still long enough to give their parents a break. There's too much to do and see and explore, too much trouble to get into. And then came Barney. I don't know exactly what it is about the purple dinosaur that's so amusing to children, but they sure do love it. I know I did. I was hooked on the show, and wanted to watch it over and over. Yes, the songs kind of drove my parents nuts, but to be able to watch their kids learning, and being excited over something that can really hold their attention span, it's worth it. I learned my ABCs and 123's, the magic words and brushing your teeth. I'd grown out of it by five or six, of course, but by that point at least I was a little more patient, and gave my parents a break. My nieces and nephew all went through the Barney stage growing up, much to their mother's delight. I know what keeps Barney on the air. He entertains. Of course there's Big Bird, Ernie, and Oscar, and they're great, too. But at the toddler stage, it seems that more kids prefer the big singing dinosaur. And that's enough for me."

1,"I was quite impressed with this movie as a child of eight or nine. The gangsters seemed very real and threatening to me, and I could see why people would have been afraid of someone like Dillinger. Seeing it as an adult, it seemed almost comical, owing to the overdone narration and jarring details like Thirties gangsters driving cars that looked like they were from the Fifties. There is a certain gritty, unglamorous reality to the way the criminals are portrayed, but the overall effect is more like a bad soap opera. The most memorable and most unintentionally funny bit that sticks with me is the scene where Ma Barker and her sons are shooting it out with the FBI and the sons are killed. The narrator says something like "" Perhaps in that moment, for the only time in her life, Ma Barker became a real mother "". This is meant to be a moment of great tragedy and pathos, as Ma finally realizes how she's destroyed her family out of her own greed, but instead, it provokes laughter. A very odd film that is rarely shown anywhere these days. Gangster movie buffs might enjoy it, but more as a curiosity than a real movie."

0,"I'd been postponing purchasing this one ever since its DVD release   for one thing, because I'd been somewhat underwhelmed by this director's two other horror titles ( SQUIRM [ 1976 ] and BLUE SUNSHINE [ 1977 ]), but also the fact that the film itself is said to have been slightly trimmed for gore on the Media Blasters/ Shriek Show 2-Disc Set! I now chanced upon it as a rental and am glad I did   because, not only is it superior to the earlier efforts ( at least, on this preliminary assessment), but I also found the film to be one of the better imitations of THE Texas CHAIN SAW MASSACRE ( 1974). This factor, however, only helped remind me that I've yet to check out another such example   Wes Craven's classic THE HILLS HAVE EYES ( 1977), whose 2-Disc R1 edition from Anchor Bay I purchased some time ago but, after all, Halloweentime is fast approaching ...   Anyway, the film manages an effortlessly unsettling backwoods atmosphere ( it was shot in the forest and mountain regions of Oregon)   with plenty of effective frissons throughout but, thankfully, not too much violence ( even if the last of the villains is dispatched in quite an outrageous fashion!). The principal young cast here ( one of them played by Jack Lemmon's son, Chris) isn't quite as obnoxious as those we usually encounter in this type of genre offering   despite freely indulging in the shenanigans one associates with teenoriented flicks and which, by and large, persist to this day! George Kennedy appears as a sympathetic Ranger; though he doesn't have a lot to do, his characterization is decidedly enhanced by making him a lover of plant and animal life. Also notable among the locals is familiar character actor Mike Kellin in a nice role as the drunkard who first comes into contact with the murderous duo of the narrative   his warning to the teenagers, naturally, goes unheeded but he's later able to lead Kennedy to them. The hermetic family the teens come across in the woods, then, is eventually revealed to be hiding a skeleton in their closet. While one of the girls displays genuine curiosity at the intruders ' presence, the rest are openly hostile to them   and, in the case of the burly and uncouth twins, appropriately creepy ( one of them is even prone to maniacal laughter during his rampages); at a certain point in the narrative, the Ranger even offers an interesting explanation as to the nature of their aggressive and generally uncivilized behavior."

1,"I'm not going to tell anyone what happens in the end, but it did not fit with the movie. The rest of Imaginary Heroes, though, portrayed a realistic family going through realistic issues, such as death, drugs, relationships, and high school. I could have sworn that they were my own family, no joke. Emile Hirsch was completely believable as a teen struggling with his brother's suicide, and Sigourney Weaver plays a mother trying to keep the remains of her ( slightly) dysfunctional family together. Although this family may take their issues to the extreme, anyone can relate to what they go through, whether it be graduation, living up to expectations, or being a parent."

When I saw the All Grown Up pilot in 2001, I thought it was interesting to see how the Rugrats would look in their preteens/ teens and it contained things that would usually happen during that time of life such as going to a concert, going to school and being grounded. The actual TV show is better because the Rugrats seem to wear different clothes in each episode and Angelica doesn't get punished as much as she did in the original Rugrats series. Tommy and Susie get punished in this series. I've also noticed references to Rugrats in this show and even flashbacks of how the Rugrats looked in the original series. They actually talk to the adults in this show because they're 10 years older. This show is aimed at a slightly older audience than the original Rugrats. Viewers of the original show may like this."

1,"I've read all the Dave Robicheaux novels and consider James Lee Burke to be my favorite contemporary fiction writer. I've also visited New Iberia and much of Acadiana to be able to better visualize the setting in most of these books. Needless to say, I greatly anticipated seeing "" In the Electric Mist, "" especially since I thought Tommy Lee Jones would be terrific as Robicheaux. I was greatly disappointed. The story was very choppy; the interplay with the "" ghosts of Confederate dead "" was shallow and lost the impact and nobility it added to the book; and Tommy Lee Jones was doleful, expressionless and difficult to understand as DR. The best way to describe this forgettable film is to add my "" ditto "" to an earlier user comment that this movie was like one of those old madeforTV movies. I expected Jill St. John or Cameron Mitchell to show up at any time. The location settings were accurate, and the photography at times captured the essence of the steamy bayous, smoky juke joints and eerie aboveground graveyards of South Louisiana. Too bad the story's disjointed presentation and Tommy Lee's subpar performance interfered with the unique mood and spicy zest of the region. Next to final comment: In the novels, Dave Robicheaux's nickname is "" Streak, "" because of the distinct streak of silvergray hair on one side of his head. ( Similar to how the Sopranos ' Paulie Walnuts would appear if he were seen only in profile.) Tommy Lee had no such streak in this film, probably because the editors are James Lee Burke fans and they airbrushed the streak out after witnessing Mr. Jones's poor imitation of Dave Robicheaux. Final comment: While I generally find Alec Baldwin to be pompous and obnoxious in most roles, he was by far a better Robicheaux in "" Heaven's Prisoners "" than Tommy Lee was in "" In the Electric Mist. "" Also, Heaven's Prisoners is much more interesting and exciting, with uniformly believable performances and more evocative atmosphere than this new movie. "" In the Electric Mist "" is okay to watch when one feels like "" veging out "" and there's nothing better on TV. But then, so are infomercials."

0,"I, like many folks, believe the 1989 epic Lonesome Dove was one of the best westerns ever produced, maybe THE best. And, realizing that most sequels ( in this case a prequel) are certain to disappoint, my expectations were low. Comanche Moon met that expectation with its marginal directing and acting, poor casting and frankly, a lousy script.   Lonesome Dove created western heroes of Captains McCrae and Call due to incredibly strong performances by Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones. Prior to living in Lonesome Dove, we believed they bravely fought to rid Texas of bandits and savage Indians during their rangering years.   If I had only seen Comanche Moon, I would think these two boneheads were a couple of incompetent, cowardly idiots. In Lonesome Dove, Call and McCrae supposedly chased Blue Duck all over Texas and never managed to capture or kill him. In Comanche Moon, a shot to Call's boot heel convinced him to settle down and raise cattle. There wasn't a decent fistfight or gun fight in the entire miniseries. The best punch was McCrea sucker punching Inez Scull, a funny scene but out of character for McCrae. Where was McCrae's wit and charm? Clara's love for McCrae, a drunken, unshaven slob and philanderer was completely implausible. And Maggie's love for Call, a dispassionate and sullen loner, defies logic.   The cinematography was excellent, superior to the original. Credit goes not only to HD technology, but the cinematographer. The Comanche Moon miniseries was better than anything else on TV for three nights, but sadly that's not saying much."

0,"If there's one word I can associate to this movie, its ' embarrassment '. It must be embarrassing to everyone associated with the movie, to actually watch it in a theatre. Everythingthe script, screenplay, dialogues, song lyrics, directionshoddy, lousy. Saw this movie when I was a kid. Liked it then, mainly because it was a fantasy, a superheromovie. Its a notsoexplored genre in Hindi cinema. The attempt deserves credit, but that's all there is to it. Sashi Kapoor seems to have been in a great hurry in making the movie. Can't understand the reason behind casting foreigners as Hindispeaking characters, who can't even get the sync right ( nothing to say about the dubbing). The screenplay is terrible. The editing even more. If one follows the dialogues closely, one can detect grammaticallywrong sentences ( which completely alter the intended meaning). Nothing special about the music. The biggest embarrassment must be for the Censor board. There are a couple of nipslip scenes in the movie, one of which is absolutely clear ( so much so that I can't even think of a metaphor). The director missed them. The editing team missed it. And the censor board missed it too. So much for the noindecentexposureon screen motto. The officials probably fell asleep while watching the movie. Can't think of why Amitabh went with the role. It might be because he was a good friend of the Kapoors. But the role hardly has anything for him. With wonderful roles in Hum and Agneepath behind him, he couldn't have followed it up with a worse one. There are a couple of heroic scenes, really worthy ones. But otherwise, they're embarrassingly unbelievable ( arrowcatching for instance .. it probably could've been better with CGI, but it was ' 91 ..). Dimple and Sonam do not exactly set the screen on fire. Shammi Kapoor and Rishi Kapoor give an inspired performance, but their scope is limited. Amrish Puri is his usual self in the role of a fairytale villain ( letting out the villainous laugh every now and then). On the whole, an interesting concept. Could have been a lot more better."

1,"If you want to see the true, vile nature of Communism, watch the movie DARK BLUE WORLD. ( Tvamomodr Svet) It recounts how the brave Czech pilots who refused to surrender fled to England to join the fight against the Nazis. After the war, the Communists feared they had picked up dangerous Western ideas about freedom. So, they had these heroic Czech pilots thrown into a nightmarish prison, where some of the guards were the same Nazis they risked their lives to defeat. If Hollywood wants to understand why so many of their movies fall flat, they should compare the character drama portions of "" Pearl Harbor "" with this movie. In Dark Blue World, you really make a connection to all the characters. In Pearl Harbor, everyone is like some slick cartoon version of a real person. There are innumerable instances of brilliant writing in this movie. One funny scene that sticks in my mind is when the character Karel is being taught English by a rather formal Englishwoman. When he can't pronounce a word, he ridicules the lesson. In typical stoic English fashion, the teacher calmly but forcefully confronts Karel, and shames him into behaving. The aerial battle sequences in this movie are amazing, and they help to keep the movie lively. I read that it cost$ 11,000 an hour to rent the planes, but it was worth every penny. Ladies, you are expected to cry at sad movies, but guys .... beware! This movie would make General Patton weep. And if you are a dog lover, you'll use up half a box of Kleenex. Don't say I didn't warn you."

0,"In 1932, Humphrey Bogart was a relative unknown -- an unproven actor who was starring in one of his first films. And, because he was an unknown, the movie they gave him was clearly a Bmovie -- a quick film with relatively low expectations. After seeing it, I could see why it would still take Bogart many more years AND another film studio before he became a household name. While the film isn't terrible, it certainly isn't good -- making it more of a curiosity than anything else when seen today. Bogart is a pilot who has dreams of building his own aircraft engine company. However, when a vacuous rich playgirl comes his way, his dreams all seem to go on hold. As one of the characters in the film said, the combination of the two is like oil and water -- they just don't mix. While Bogart is throwing away his promising career, his sister is going full speed on the Road to Skankville -- having met a sleazy guy who convinces her to sleep with rich guys so they can shake them down for tons of cash! Bogey has no idea his sister ISN'T the actress she claims to be and doesn't realize later that the rich woman he loves leaves him for the same guy whose mistress is .... Bogart's SISTER!!! All this leads up to a finale that is reasonably enjoyable. However, what follows is one of the dumbest scenes I have watched in a very long time! By now, the rich lady is not going to marry the guy sleeping with Bogey's sister ( whew!) but because she's now poor and no good for Bogart, she's about to fly away and kill herself. Bogey finds out, chases the plane on foot, jumps on the plane as it's taking off and crawls up the fuselage to take control of the plane and save her!!! This is so utterly silly and ridiculous, I found myself laughing out loud. Up until then, I might have scored it a 4 or 5-this sunk the movie to a 3 ( how one reviewer gave this an 8 is beyond me). The bottom line is that this was a talking and silly film. On top of that, it's all wrong for Bogart, as the action hero at the end and the simpering lover are horrible matches for his persona that was so wonderfully created in the early 40s. Manly and solid better suits the man -- one of America's great actors but clearly out of his element here. By the way, those who love PreCode films and their very adult sensibilities may want to see this one. Practically everyone in the film believes in and practices premarital sex and Bogey curses in the film -- things you never would have seen after the toughened and more moralistic Production Code was adopted in 1934."

Seymour was a big, fuzzy, green puppet, with a crescent smile of enormous teeth which nearly split his head, I recall him wearing a variety of Elton Johntype shades. He "" played "" piano, and had a Jesus looking dude in a white tux, sitting next to him. They would have a moral discussion and then do a song about it. Don't remember much else except the opening theme, Seymour and the Hippie. No one else I know remembers it at all. I grew up in Jersey, so if it was produced in Detroit as a previous post said, it wasn't just local. Seymour reminded me a lot of Sherlock the Squirrel from the Magic Garden ( another psychedelic kids show if there ever was one.) People always talk about LSD's effects of music and movies of the 70s, but it seems kid's show writers got a dose as well."

Whoever the prick writers were that decided to turn such a great movie into this garbage should have done some research, instead of filling it with oneliners and hollow new characters, and the classic jokes from the first movie OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN. Sure they get a little creative, but its like seeing the same episode with a small twist. Pretty much like listening to Creed, or Nickleback. Kuzco has to prevent himself from failing, Yzma has a complicated plan, but decides to go the easy way to save time and just use a potion, someone questions the monkey and the bug, Bucky appears in the background, Kuzco flirts with Malina, she disses him without sounding like a bitch, Yzma disguises herself as "" Principal Amzy "" and she calls Kronk, and he forgets that she is Yzma. I admit, this show does have it's moments. Another problem is the fact that Yzma looks younger and Pacha looks .... weird. Also, no one can replace David Spade and John Goodman! Their the ones who made Kuzco and Pacha Kuzco and Pacha! Sorry, but i give this show two thumbs down."

The action, when it is there, is decent and Jack Palance, Elias Koteas, and Angelina Jolie are always dependable. It's the fact that this is a sequel to the terrible Jean Claude Van Damme film, or is that the capper to the Masters of the Universe trilogy? I'm still confused about that. Either way, there was really no need for this movie. What was there a need for? Angelina Jolie. She may play an assassin robot that can explodes midcoitus, but, what a way to go and even though this is her first movie, she still has the presence that made her an award winner."

1,"It's common knowledge and has been said before: No one can ever play Scarlett and Rhett like Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable. Joanne Whalley Kilmer ( no longer Kilmer having been divorced from exhubby Val Kilmer) plays her own Scarlett and although this is a sequel and not a remake ( Godforbid!!!) she still can not rise to the occasion ( i.e. her voice sounds evil on several occasions, she's got brown eyes [ Scarlett in both novels had green eyes and even Vivien Leigh's eyes were green ] and her vocal power was not up to the job either. Scarlett is a Southern Belle; therefore she has an incredible talent for flirting ( as she did in SCARLETT the novel and GWTW, of course) and to be a great flirt like Scarlett is, you would most likely need a higherpitched voice, like Vivien Leigh.   I suppose I'm comparing Kilmer to Leigh a bit too much but when someone possesses a role so masterfully as Leigh did with Scarlett you simply can't help but to criticize any new prospective Scarletts. Timothy Dalton should have had no accent whatsoever, due to the fact that both Margaret Mitchell's Rhett and Gable in the film had none. His acting has never been truly noteworthy ( except, maybe his portrayal of the evil, conniving King Phillip of France in THE LION IN WINTER) and he gives very little ( if any) freshness or vitality to his Rhett.    Standouts in the cast are most notably Tina Kellagher ( a born actress with plenty of authenticity in her deliverance) as the tragic victim Mary Boyle. And then of course there's Sean Bean as the cold, calculating and not to mention, almost demonically evil Lord Fenton, Mary's nemesis and Scarlett's eventual violator. One thing I could not forgive the writer for was the fact that Scarlett is raped in this movie ( a fact that never occurred in the novel; Lord Fenton is cold and of illrepute among the Irish in the book but he's nowhere near as heartless as his screen counterpart. Another omission from the novel but readded for the film is the character of Belle Watling, played most horribly by AnnMargret in a cameo role, which we all could have lived without, seeing as how the book was such a runaway bestseller without requiring any assistance from Ms. Watling.   For a film by itself, SCARLETT is a very good one but not quite in that lofty of a place in terms of being GONE WITH THE WINDs sequel. Another actress was highly necessary for Scarlett as well as Rhett."

The two couldn't be more different, but they share one thingboth were killed by the same woman.

Bruce Campbell returns to the B horror movie genre that gave him his cult status, this time not only in front of the screen, but behind the lens. Unfortunately for this time around, the laughs don't deliver and Campbell has to resort to what he does best to try and fill the gap in this film. As a fan of Campbell, who has the movies, the books and the action figures, I was hoping for another hit to add to my collection. Although, after seeing this film before the purchase, I am glad that I don't have the "" pleasure "" of adding it. The film first goes wrong in the story, which at first sight, seems like harmless fun but turns out to be boring drawn out dribble. Which is a sad thing to say because it was written by Mr. Campbell himself. The comedy never really hits, it only makes us scratch our heads. It seems that Campbell ran out of things that are funny and resulted in giving the audience what we've already seen ... him fighting himself. Ted Raimi, the brother of Evil Dead director Sam Raimi, is undoubtedly the highlight of the film. He brings a freshness to it and an entertaining time when the film really needs it. It helps if you are a fan and have been following these stooges from Evil Dead to Xena, which is why I felt compelled to like this film. Campbell's experience as a director, from directing episodes of the TV series Hercules is apparent. Campbell makes the film work well enough, even with the lowbudget. In the end, there aren't as many things going for this as one would hope for, but the fans of Campbell will stick behind it no matter what, unfortunately for this fan ... I won't."

1,"Maybe, like most others who have seen this film long after it's premiere on television, I wanted to see many of my favorite actors in old and obscure form, which is exactly what ' Slow Burn ' is. Except, aside from the nostalgic value, the movie itself is not very good. Eric Roberts plays former reporter Jacob Ash, hired by a Gerald McMurty ( Raymond J. Barry), a rich artist, to investigate the whereabouts of his estranged son, Brian, who had been living with his mother, Laine ( Beverly D'Angelo) for the past few years. In a Phillip Marloweesquire fashion Jacob Ash narrates what would become more than just an investigation into the whereabouts of Brian. But, once Jacob tracks down Laine, his discoveries break open wide a whole lot of trouble. Perhaps because events in the film move too slowly, there is never much suspense to this little thriller, not even by the end with the finale routine of revealing the culprits and their motives. However, as said before, this movie is probably one that will draw attention for it's thenrelatively unknown cast of actors, which include both a very young Eric Roberts as well as the adorable Johnny Depp, who plays Laine's stepson, Donnie. That may be reason enough to give it a try ... if you can find it."

Domino was the seedling which I watered. I watered her so very often. Everywhere Sharky. Her scented petals, her proud stalk, everywhere. She will wither under your ridiculous hose, like the souffl removed from the oven five minute too soon. I must go now Sharky, you bore me so with your disgraceful behaviour. It is you who will be flushed down le pissoir like the smelly thing. Bon chance!"
0,"Most of Chaplin's most famous films are his fulllength features. And, I assume most people have at most seen only a few clips of him from his prefeature days when he starred in dozens and dozens of comedy shorts. This is really a shame, as some wonderful shorts are pretty much waiting to be discovered by the world in the 21st century. If someone watches this film they have an excellent chance to see some of Chaplin's better shorts because Chaplin himself chose these three shorts and strung them together with a bit of narration to make this 1959 feature film. This is great for several reasons. First, in Chaplin's earliest films from 19141915, his character of the Little Tramp is still in its earliest incarnations or is absent altogether. Plus, even when he is there, he was often meanspirited and selfcentered -- something very alien from the Little Tramp we have grown to love. Second, because the shorts that were chosen were in great condition, if you watch this film you won't need to worry about watching scratchy film with gaps and lousy musical accompaniment that doesn't fit the action ( a common problem). So, for a great look at Chaplin's shorts at their finest, give this film a chance. It's sure to provide you some excellent laughs."

0,"My friends and I have watched this so many time I have lost count. This is worth seeing for those in the right frame of mind, meaning that this is not so much a good horror film as a film to lampoon for its funny quotes and bad effects. This film is best watched with other like minded individuals so you have someone to laugh with. You'll laugh as Greg leaps and shuffles around the lab, petting his pet rabbit, while his hunchback shifts from right to left on his back. "" Greg, stop clowning! "", scolds Dr. Brandon. You'll laugh as J.G. Patterson gives hand signals to direct Greg to the other side of the operating table, while his hand is in the shot. And you'll probably chuckle when you realize that the final woman has none of the features he used to construct her with."

1,"Nearwonderful mixture of comedy, romance, and medical chaos has a 50-ish swingingsingle doctor, tired of going to rock concerts with nubile airheads, dating a patient his own age whom he met on his rounds. Screenplay by Julius Epstein shows a fair amount of sophistication, though he doesn't have enough material to fill out the picture's last third, and one can almost feel the movie slipping. The subplot about the hospital being investigated for its shoddy business affairs isn't worked out satisfactorily, and it feels highly concocted anyway. Still, Walter Matthau and Glenda Jackson are a terrific team, Richard Benjamin and Art Carney very funny in support. Director Howard Zieff keeps it all popping, and even when Epstein's oneliners feel like Neil Simon rejects, Zieff zips right along happily. The results are dryly engaging and occasionally quite sweet. Followed by a failed TV series.*** from****"

0,"Ocean's Twelve: just plain stupid, bad and nothing compared to the other two. An art robbery. 10 known actors, at least. A weak script and very slow developing idea.

If Ocean's 12 it's not about Heist then what's the point to see it? Glad Soderberg saw his main error and redeemed himself by making a film far superior to the first one. Kudos for that. Steven Soderberg isn't really a good director. Apart from his hit "" Sex lies and videotapes "" ... nothing else happened so much great to the career of this director. Shame on him.

0,"Oh dear! The BBC is not about to be knocked off its pedestal for absorbing period dramas by this one. I agree this novel of Jane Austens is the difficult to portray particularly to a modern audience, the heroine is hardly a Elizabeth Bennet, even Edmund is not calculated to cause female hearts to skip a beat. However I must say I was hoping for an improvement on the last and was sadly disappointed. The basic story was preserved, but the dialogue was so altered that all that was Jane Austen's tone, manner, feeling, wit, depth, was diluted if not lost. If some past adaptions may be seen as dated the weakness of this one must be that it is too modern ( ' his life is one long party '?????) The cast was generally adequate, but I think Billie Piper was the wrong choice, it needed someone more restrained, I gained no impression of hidden depths beneath a submissive exterior, she was more like a frolicking child. I see I must wait for the BBC to weave its magic once again."

1,One of Bolls better attempts. Just shows that if you do something long enough you have to improve just by chance. It is still not good but it is at least watchable which is an improvement over the bloodrayne. The main difference between Bloodrayne and FarCry really is that the story from Farcry wasn't the games strong point whereas Bloodrayne had a strong story and thus Boll had more chance to mess it up. The action in this movie is actually fairly good. Occasionally a touch overdone but in a good way and worth a watch just for that. Acting wise it was pretty decent. Most of the actors are pretty good but you can tell they aren't taking it seriously based on comparisons with other performances. But the lighter mood this gives to the film actually helps. While I think sticking a little bit closer to the story of the game might have made for a slightly better film the changes made are pretty practical and not big enough to make a difference. Especially given the plot of the game was hardly Oscar winning just a vehicle for FPS carnage. Would have liked it set in the Jungle as that was a pretty integral part of the game but Canada doesn't have a great deal of Jungle and it is at least set in a kind of rainforest. Why Boll feels the need to change already professionally scripted and directed game plots I don't know but he does. And until he starts letting the source material speak through his adaptations will always be lacking. Watch the film for a laugh its good for that and maybe for watching during a party as drinking party fodder.

0,"People comparing this movie to big blockbusters like Lord of the Rings or the Matrix will inevitably be disappointed with the way this movie turned out. Although it lacks in the big special effects department and there are no battles with hundreds of extras, there is still a masterful amalgamation of two old folk tales here. The acting talent, although not Alist, is still great and the interaction between the characters is perhaps more sincere than in a larger movie with an Alist cast. My particular favourite from this movie is Bridget Fonda, whose performance as the Snow Queen herself was quite moving, assisted enormously by a stupendous wardrobe and makeup. She injected humanity and a sense of pathos into the character of the fallen season corrupted by the devil's evil magic. Fonda aside the acting was not what we have come to expect from Hollywood, which I think is a good thing since Hollywood seems to have run out of ideas on how to train its acting talent to portray roles and so they have become stale and reliant on CGI and other special effects to take us away from the actors who all use the same tricks on us. Instead it shows new ideas some real thinking on the part of the actors about how they can find new variations on the the old themes of love and danger."

0,"Perhaps this movie is a little too long, but it still has some charm 45 years later. The main roles seem more appropriate for Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh. I could care less about Gary Cooper, but Ingrid Bergman is fine, particularly in dark hair. The movie is worth seeing for the supporting cast: Flora Robson is terrific as a mulatto servant. She is a white woman in blackface, and can have an expression of evil or of a voodoo mistress. Jerry Austin as a servant dwarf has a delightful role, that keeps you chuckling despite some overlong scenes. Speaking of scenes, Florence Bates steals most of the ones she is in as a dowager social lady. I didn't understand the outcome of the railroad fight at the end of the movie, and the last scene was pure Hollywood dreck. It's an odd feeling when you realize the film title refers to a railroad rather than a piece of luggage!"

1,"Pitch Black is a survival story. It's about how to survive in an hostile, alien world against even more hostile enemies. The task gets even more difficult when the nearest enemies can be found within your own surviving group. The plot of Pitch Black is quite usual and has been seen several times before in different variations. But what makes this movie shine above others, is it's wellwritten characters. The group consists of very different people with few more interesting than the others: Jack, a boy with a secret; Fry, a pilot having hard time with her own conscience; Johns, a bounty- hunter with a drughabit; Imam, a holy man facing the fact that God is sometimes cruel and Riddick, a convict and a murderer learning to value others, not only himself. Characters start to live in the movie. They aren't only paper like in many other movies of this genre. You start to care for the characters, especially for Riddick though that feels quite odd. He is supposed to be the bad guy. In this movie, the line between light and pitch black is very thin. All characters are familiar with both. Other thing that works in this movie is the casting. Rarely do actors fit to their roles this well. Radha Mitchell is suitable for Fry. Cole Hauser brings the right amount of cruelness and sense of responsibility for Johns. But the most impressive work is done by Vin Diesel. He does great job as Riddick. In his hands Riddick is quite creepy, definitely very dangerous and also deep character, just as he is supposed to be. So, how do you survive in Pitch Black? Keep your friends close and enemies even closer."

Narrated by Clint Eastwood, the theme is definitely "" Gary Coooper, American "" as we are taken through fast clips of his many appearances in westerns, and scenes from "" Meet John Doe, "" "" Mr. Deeds Goes to Town, and "" Sgt. York. "" The best part of the documentary is the home movies of Cooper and his family as well as his childhood photos, showing him as a beautiful blonde kid with the sunny smile he would have his entire life. There is also a hilarious clip of Cooper on "" The Jack Benny Show "" doing the comeback on the number "" Bird Dog ""and Benny loses it. The documentary also takes us briefly through his tumultuous affair with Patricia Neal, which nearly ruined both their lives. There's a certain cohesiveness missing from this bio/ retrospectiveit jumps around a lot and has no footage of Cooper being interviewed, which would have added a lot. Also, Clint Eastwood's narration was described as unobtrusive. What it was, was boring and monotone. Given that Cooper himself tended to be the strong, silent type on screen, we could have used a little animation. On a personal note, Gary Cooper was one of the handsomest men who ever livedthere were some looks at him in his early films, but not nearly enough for this fan. That smile, those lips, that bone structurehe was handsome throughout his life, but in films like "" Morocco "" and "" Desire, "" he is devastating.

However, compared to its contemporaries, it's a pretty good cartoon and still holds up well. That's because despite its age, the cartoon is very creative and funny. Felix meets a guy whose shoe business is folding because he can't sell any shoes. Well, Felix needs money so he can go to Hollywood, so he tells the guy at the shop he'll get every shoe sold. Felix spreads chewing gum all over town and soon people are stuck and leave their shoes -- rushing to buy new ones from the shoe store. In gratitude, the guy gives Felix$ 500! However, Felix's owner wants to take the money and go alone, so Felix figures out a way to sneak along. Once there, Felix barges into a studio and makes a bit of a nuisance of himself. Along the way, he meets cartoon versions of comics Ben Turpin and Charlie Chaplin. In the end, though, through luck, Felix is discovered and offered a movie contract. Hurray!"

0,"So I caught this one afternoon as "" What Lies Above "" and actually watched it because the beginning was somewhat promising. The heroine, Diana Pennington, is a mountain climbing expert ... but that doesn't help her when her fianc Brian gets hurt on a climb. When she goes off to get help and returns, he disappears from the mountain, never to be seen again. Two years later, Diana is still a climber ... but she won't go near Snowman's Pass. That is, until Curt Seaver appears and tells her that he can find the body of her lost fianc with a new satellite program. She agrees and they take off up the mountain with Curt's two assistants: His "" bodyguard "" Hugo and the computer whiz Tyler. From the start, you know that there's some ulterior motive going on, but unfortunately the twists aren't good and lead to a laughably bad chase sequence that makes up the last 20 or 30 minutes of the movie. The major disappointments are the red herrings, most of which have supernatural undertones that never come to fruition. The object from the sky that fell into the mountains ( which turns out to be not so supernatural), the story of how Snowman's Pass came to be, and the most memorable one of them all: Diana's dream sequence halfway through the movie. But what disappointed me most is where they dropped the ball. The majority of the movie revolves around the search for Brian, that's why I can't for the life of me begin to understand why the mystery of what exactly happened to him and where he was is never solved through the course of the movie. This was the major plot. This was how the movie STARTED! How do you NOT wrap that up? I wouldn't tell too many people to bother with this one ..."

But I am really writing to comment on an earlier poster's article. Um, Michael Praed did not leave ROS to do Jules Verne! There are 15 years between these two series. Yup, I agree and Michael might well agree too that leaving ROS was not a good move -- but it was a coveted Broadway role that tempted him in ' 84 and then Dynasty with its megabucks paychecks ...."
1,"Spoiler warning!!! This is probably my least favourite Cary Grant film. I spent most of the time thinking: ignore him, leave him etc. Is he trying to kill her? Should we assume that after the end, when he persuades her to return home with him, that he will kill her after all? I see from checking in a couple of books that this is a reading that some viewers/ critics have taken. Finishing early is after all a more reasonable way to film a book, than to change the endingand this is a more unreasonable change of ending than, for example, in Altman's The Long Goodbye. Unlike Hitchcock's earlier example of making the murderer not the murderer because a star has been cast ( when Gosford Park refers to The Lodger, Ivor Novello's murderous habits are not mentioned) the book's ending is not definitely ruled out.

0,"Spoiler warning!!! This is probably my least favourite Cary Grant film. I spent most of the time thinking: ignore him, leave him etc. Is he trying to kill her? Should we assume that after the end, when he persuades her to return home with him, that he will kill her after all? I see from checking in a couple of books that this is a reading that some viewers/ critics have taken. Finishing early is after all a more reasonable way to film a book, than to change the endingand this is a more unreasonable change of ending than, for example, in Altman's The Long Goodbye. Unlike Hitchcock's earlier example of making the murderer not the murderer because a star has been cast ( when Gosford Park refers to The Lodger, Ivor Novello's murderous habits are not mentioned) the book's ending is not definitely ruled out. In Robin Wood's Hitchcock's Films Revisited, he writes: "" As one mentally ' swiches ' from ending to ending, the significance of every scene changes, the apparent solidity of the narrative dissolves, the illusion of the fiction's ' reality ' disintegrates, the film becomes a ' modernist ' text in which the process of narrative is foregrounded.

1,"That distinction has to go to THE DUNGEON OF HARROW. At least Ed Wood's misguided attempt at making a quality science fiction film had the dubious "" star "" power of Bela Lugusi, Vampira, Tor Johnson, Criswell and Lyle Talbot. THE DUNGEON OF HARROW has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. What could have been an interesting and suspenseful plot about a marooned aristocrat on a leper colony, perhaps in the style of THE ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU or MYSTERIOUS ISLAND, is trashed by the heavy dialog and mono tonal acting of amateurs whose lines sink like lead weights into a sea of stupidity. The "" special effects "", which took place in someone's bathtub, further doom this film to the dung heap. Even the treatment of leprosy is something out of a Victorian interpretation of the Bible. The fact that leprosy can not be contracted from an individual in its last stages belies the plot line that the aristocrat Fallon and his lady, Cassandra contract the disease and end up as the original occupants of the Castle De Sade, doomed to insanity and inhuman cruelty. It is interesting to note that not one member of the cast made another film. No wonder, talent begets talent; lack of talent begets oblivion, which is where this film should find its deplorable end."

0,"The Kissing Bandit was the third and final film that Frank Sinatra and Kathryn Grayson costarred at MGM with. The first two were Anchors Aweigh and It Happened in Brooklyn. And in both Sinatra wooed and lost Grayson. I guess the third time's the charm. For romance maybe, but definitely not for screen image. Sinatra in his forty's films once again plays the nice little schnook only this time in toreador pants. Poaching on Tyrone Power's territory laid out in The Mark of Zorro, Sinatra plays the son of a man who was a hotel owner by day and The Kissing Bandit by night. He's gone and left California for an education and has come back ready to take Dad's place, but in the hotel business only. And where does he learn the hotel business, Boston. Of course some of Dad's former gang members, grown a little old and paunchy led by J. Carrol Naish, want him to lead the gang again. But Frank's just not cut out for the outlaw life. But he does make a good impression on the Governor's daughter, Kathryn Grayson. Somebody must have had it in for Sinatra at MGM to cast him in this after the bad reviews he got in Miracle of the Bells. Frank's in a part that was more suitable for Red Skelton. But since this was a musical, I guess the brain trust at MGM figured Kathryn Grayson had to have a singing costar. In fact the best number in the film are for her, Love Is Where You Find It. Also Ricardo Montalban, Ann Miller, and Cyd Charisse do a dance specialty that is nice. Frank's songs are nice, but nothing spectacular. In later years, Sinatra would wince at the mention of The Kissing Bandit and with good reason."

Ten years later Kersey seems to have learned unarmed combat and how to handle anti tank weapons in his spare time. But I`ll overlook that gaffe because DW3 is the best of the sequels, lowlife scum bags get shot dead, burned alive, their teeth smashed, and thrown to their deaths by middle aged housewives armed with sweeping brushes. Yeah I know the gang members are multi ethnic and for that they deserve some credit but even if they`re not racist they`re still murdering scum who deserve all they get from Kersey and the innocent citizens. Who needs Mayor Rudy when you`ve got Paul Kersey, an anti tank rocket and a bunch of old age pensioners to reclaim the streets from the criminal creeps. Paul Kersey I salute you sir"

It was also brilliant to see Alan's bum going up and down like a fiddler's elbow later on in the film.

Alan must be brought back into Eastenders so he can do the same to Peggy. Alan is back, and this time he's armed with a razor.

The Francis Durbridge serials all seemed to inhabit the same universe, that of unexplained happenings, people being not what they seem & the villain being someone close to the hero/ victim.

1,"This could have been great. The voiceovers are exactly right and fit the characters to a T. One small problem though; the look of the characters, mostly the supporting or guest characters look exactly the same. The same bored look on every face only with minor changes such as hairlines or weight size. It looks kind of odd to see a really big guest star's voice coming out of a lifeless form like the characters here. If I am not mistaken Kathy Griffin did a voiceover for this show and it looked too odd to be funny. There is a few other problems, one being the family plot. The Simpsons did it much better where you could actually buy most of the situations the characters got themselves into. Here we get too much annoying diversions, like someone having a weird fantasy and then we are supposed to find that funny but for some reason the delivery is a bit off. As you can probably tell it is hard for me to put a finger on exactly what is wrong with this show because it basically nothing more than a clone of the Simpsons or even more "" Married with Children "". If I should point a finger on what is totally wrong with this it probably is it's repetitiveness. Peter Griffin is not really a bright character but neither are any of the others. Lois should have been named Lois Lame because she is sort of onedimensional. Seth Green as the kind of retarded son is the best thing about this show and that is the most stereotypical part on the show. So what more can I say. There isn't exactly anything wrong with this show but in the long run you have to admit that it takes a lot of work to do what the Simpsons has done for almost two decades."

0,"This film is a cash in. A cash in reliant on a rousing theme tune created for an earlier classic. Yul Brynner has long since jumped ship and so have most of the production values. Lee Van Cleef takes over the lead role of Chris. I can't think of any actor who looks less like Brynner than Van Cleef. Hey, he could have at least shaved off his hair and lost the moustache, just for the sake of continuity. Some correctional centres show this movie in order to punish offenders. One step out of line and The Magnificent Seven Ride! is brought to the fore and wielded. They didn't even bother trying to make this movie not look like a TV movie! Abysmal."

1,"This film is enjoyable if you like poverty row, public domain films from the first half of the 20th century, or are a fan of amateur filmmaking. The film splices together public domain thrillers together along with newly shot scenes in which the "" actors "" ( With the sole exception of Redfield doing a near dead on Lugosi rip, all of the "" performers "" are simply dreadful!) attempt to interact with the stock footage. The "" New "" footage is covered with digitally added film scratches, as is some of the already substandard old footage (??!!). As near as I can figure out the plot has something to do with a bunch of strangers being brought together on an island for a will reading (?) This film, while boasting a creative premise ala ' Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid ', is a technical and creative wreck. In one dreadfully over long sequence and injured sailor on a ship describes an abortive trip to ' Fog Island ', whatever that is! The "" flashback "" then incoherently weaves together old footage from totally different eras, and of totally disparate film quality. Unrelated scenes from ' The Lost World ' ( 1925), The Most Dangerous Game ( 1932), White Zombie ( 1932), Bela Lugosi Meets A Brooklyn Gorilla ( 1952) and some other poverty row productions. This is done over an incredibly bad voice over which seems to have too much room echo as if the audio was recorded on a cheap home video camera. The "" filmmakers "" seem to think that they are paying homage to the great actors of yesteryear by giving characters the surnames of famous actors ( Carradine, Zucco, Ouspenskaya, etc .. etc ..). This tactic was done cleverly, as well as subtly in ' Final Destination ' here it's just obnoxious! Bizarre, and painfully unfunny, jokes about Spiderman, Dracula, and Superman abound. Even the old as dirt ' Dewey, Cheetam and Howe ' lawyer reference is used herethis was old and tired when The Three Stooges used it in the 1930s. The film stock and audio, don't match scene to scene, and dozens of different sources are used for Lugosi. The finale effect is that he seems to be getting, older, younger, older, thinner, heavier, younger and older again minute by minute. Oddly the film didn't use this as a comedy subplot and squanders a good chance for comedy. Truth be told though, It was great fun to watch this late at night in bed. Maybe that s what they wanted to happen!"

0,"This film is just as bad as "" The Birdman of Alcatraz "". I do not refer to the acting but rather the premise of both films, which try to portray psychopathic criminals as heroic figures. Moreover it disturbs me when well respected, revered actors like Alan Alda ( and Burt Lancaster) play such roles, because their status tends to lend credibility to the director's intent to elevate the film's subject, a societal outcast. I was in junior high school during the last years of Caryl Chessman's life and his death penalty appeals and books were very much in the news. I remember the groundswell of opinion that the death penalty was wrong and Chessman was the victim. Get a grip people. Read the history. Chessman was a criminal and sexual predator. He drove around the LA streets at night with a stolen police light in his vehicle. He stopped cars with attractive women inside under the ruse of making a traffic arrest; then abducted and raped the women. Rape is the worst trauma a woman can experience and many victims say they would prefer death to its horror and humiliation. Chessman got exactly what he deserved, it just took a decade too long. No sympathy for the devil here."

I always liked Chuck Norris in Films, but why do we need to make these shows politically correct by adding a black side kick who is as threatening as Shirley Temple in Little Miss Marker. I also thought the show was limited because how many times can you kick a guy in the face and make it interesting. I know an African American who looks like this Trivette guy and he gets his butt kicked about once a week he is all attitude. Chuck Norris is the man and he deserves all the kudos he gets, I think this show started great but lost steam as time went on They should have dumped Chucks side kick"

Mr Bean is a no talking, human disaster. He goes to places and gets himself in absolute mayhem, the mayhem includes: Climbing up to the top diving board and is too frightened to jump off, taking about 20 minutes, until some kids eventually throw him off, ending up inside a washing machine and driving his car while sat on a roof. Bean drives a Mini and has a teddy. This was quite similar to The Baldy Man, a series staring Gregor Fisher who says very little, but gets himself in mayhem Best Episode: Do it Yourself Mr Bean, Episode 9: Bean hosts a New Years Eve party, then gets some stuff for decorating his flat, but has too much stuff and has to drive his car on the roof."

1,"This is about as pretentious a movie as a shallow director like Joel Schumacher could make, I suppose. A group of medical students take it turns to die for several minutes; upon revival they discover that their sins have manifested themselves somehow or other. As some of the characters are visited by dead people and some just seem to be haunted by their guilty consciences it's not quite clear exactly what the connection is, but the visions do all seem to look like sixth form art films. Why the students treat their experiment as some kind of grand journey that'll make them famous is a bit of a mystery, as the results are completely unproveable and, as the movie mentions several times, have been documented plenty of times before. Still, it's nice to see Schumacher practising for his Batman trainwrecks with a bit of the old neon paint and coloured lightbulbs. And William Baldwin is a plank."

It also has the minor advantage of being popular in the fetish Shannon Doherty and smoking fetish arenas. It's a fairly mediocre attempt at a horror/ drama/ whodunit movie. It tries a little misdirection, but you can see what's coming a mile away. Shannon does a decent job with her role, but the woman playing her sister is straight out of amateurnight, as is Shannon's husband character. Avoid, unless you're one of the groups I mention above.

0,"This is one of those strange, selfimportant, selfindulgent movies which tries too hard to be profound. It isn't. Instead, it spouts cliches that try to pass for Profundity. Typical is the scene where Peter ( Kelsey Grammer) explains to protagonist and best friend Adam ( Dwier Brown) how man starts life breast feeding, then moves on to sucking the breast of his girlfriend, and finally his wife, thus concluding ultimately that life sucks. So deep. We are treated to a variety of characters who offer their perspective of life, the universe, etc. during Adam's travels through the Mojave Desert on foot. ( He abruptly leaves L.A. the day of his wedding and his family, friends, and fiance assume he's dead when his car was found in a military test range smashed by a rocket.) Some characters are more entertaining than others. The best by far is an escapee from a mental hospital who only speaks through the voices of others. The actor, James Kevin Ward, does some great impressions, including Nicholson, Popeye, and several characters from the original Star Trek. But once the interesting characters leave the screen, we're stuck with Adam again and his pursuit of the profound. It's a long trip, which drags in many places. In fact, it's the longest hour and a half movie I've ever seen. And the finale hardly makes it seem worth while, at all. I discovered this movie playing on HBO one day by waking up too early and clicking on the TV. That'll learn me. Next time I'll try harder to sleep in."

The movie begins with a strong launch, and infected by a borevirus throughout the middle to end. The weakest spot is the presentation of the basic plot/ story.

This explain why Patrick Stewart joins the fleet of enterprise in Star Trek Next Generation; he wanted to find more models in glass cage, floating inside HalleyComet.

And let's talk about the cast -- who are these people?? I have never heard of a one of them. Truly dissatisfying. This movie shows why TV movies are just that, TV movies."

The thinking behind it is that if you made a film full of pop songs you could stick the tracks on a LP, sell it and make even more money for the studio.

This is a good business deal but an artistic disaster because many of us still have nightmares about Hollywood movies from the 1980s and I rate the mid 1980s as the poorest time in artistic terms for American film making and FLASHDANCE opened the door to this "" Let's make a 90 minute pop video instead of a movie "" type film making Jennifer Beals plays Alex Owens a dancer who works as a welder to make ends meet and right away logic disappears with this career choice. Welding is a fairly sophisticated trade, it's not something you walk into and learn in five minutes.

1,"This movie was a dismal attempt at recreating a crucial time in English history. The film version of Cromwell's growing involvement in the War is marginally accurate but the overall historical accuracy of this movie was way off. This film implies that the war was started over religious differences but the Civil War was in no way Catholic versus Protestant: both sides were Protestant. Cromwell was never present at the battle of Edgehill, nor did he ever "" save the day "". The royalists did not win, the battle ended in a draw. As another reviewer has noted, Cromwell was certainly not one of the "" Five Members "" who were to be removed from the House and arrested.   Overall, this movie was decent. The producers tried WAY to hard and it didn't turn out so great.   definitely could have been better."

0,"This movie was strange mainly because the plot was so incoherent. The title refers to a vicious wind which renders the surface of the earth almost uninhabitable when it blows, but this seemed to have nothing whatsoever to do with what was going on. The movie seems to be an extremely poor ripoff of Bladerunner ie rogue android being chased by bounty hunter(or ruthless cop in this). Luke Skywalker turns in a surprisingly good performance as aforementioned rogue cop. Nothing seems to be resolved at the end of the movie, we never find out anything of any substance about the android or what his intentions are. There is one baffling scene where Bill Paxton(who has kidnapped the android) plays one particular song in his cardboard airplane for no particular reason(the song is called "" Shape of things "", by The Yardbirds). This happens again in a later scene where the same song is played for no apparent reason. Does this song have any relevance to the movie? Don't think so."

I don't know how Ulrich Thomsen does it, but somehow he can manage to play insane in a very sane way. BUT if you don't understand Danish ( I am not referring to your pastry here) don't waste your time on this   I don't think it would work with subtitles."

1,"This one is one of those classic B movie following the exploits of 2 hobos. It's done really cheesily and Big Stupid running off oneliners like a cardboard cassanova. But Jack Elam steals every scene he's in as the creepazoid Jesse ( now Jerome!). My favorite scene is the lynch mob and the dad's voice going up 10 octaves ( "" You loved her? ""). Danny, Big Stupid's protege, is surprisingly stupider, but not as loathsome as our lead star. There's also a quaint scene of a guy pimping at the diner. Joyce Meadows is the sweet, naive nice gal and probably the least annoying. And those yellow ruffles ( RAWR!). Oh, and booze is evil according to Mr. Stupid. This movie's a hoot. Watch the MST cover of this and Crow's terrific Elam homage!"

In one of the most delicious sec comedies in drivein history a bevy of bouncing young lovelies all come together in a tale of battling bikinied sorority sisters who will stop at nothing to bare everything. So what does H.O.T.S really stand for? You're going to have to watch the movie to get the answer. You see, the girls are having there problems with the society girls on campus that make them out to be nothing but sex craved maniacs. Therefore, the girls set out to discredit the society girls no matter what they have to do to get the job done. In addition, cut up in this mess is the Dean of the college who wants to dismantle the group of girls before they grow out of control. I loved this movie especially Lisa London. I thought her acting was fantastic and I'm disappointed that she didn't get other acting jobs. Based on the three playmates alone I give this movie 10 weasel stars."

1,"This series doesn't present the British view of the Revolutionary War, so much as an antiAmerican view of it. The underlying theme of the series is that a silent majority of colonists enjoyed British rule; that the founding fathers were manipulative schemers whose only goal was to draw Britain into a violent civil war; that the American supporters of the revolution and the militia were racist, violent louts, duped into the struggle. Clearly, the intent of the author, Richard Holmes, is for the viewer to extrapolate these characteristics, in a straight line, from the American population of 1775 to today. For example, in the episode "" The Shot Heard Around the World "" Holmes dredges up an obscure print of the Boston Massacre, in which he claims the skin of Crispus Attucks, a black man and the first man killed in the revolution, was purposely "" whited out "". Holmes claims that portraying Attucks as a black man would have been bad propaganda for the revolutionary cause. Holmes never reveals how he knows this. And there's more. Holmes goes to some length to work in a single, unsubstantiated, atrocity: the desecration of the body of a British soldier. He compares the American militia to the Viet Cong and the mujahadeen -- without mentioning any differences in the goals of these groups. The list goes on. Supposedly, this series was made in response to Mel Gibson's "" The Patriot "". It says a lot when an academic feels the need to respond to Mel Gibson on any topic. Instead of presenting the British view, it seems Holmes really wanted to give a sensationalistic, antiAmerican view, and, in the process, he's made himself the Roger Corman of historians -- strictly thirdrate schlock."

1,"This was the first directing job by Sebastian Gutierrez, the writer of Snakes on a Plane and Gothika. Anyone who has read my reviews knows that I love capers, and this was a doozy. A kidnapping and a woman shot in the process. The FBI has Emma Thompson on the kidnapping case and the Police Chief ( Roscoe Lee Browne) assigns Alan Rickman to solve the murder, which happens to be a Senator's ( Hal Holbrook) wife. These two make an outstanding pair as they work together. The kidnappers/ murderers have lovers Simon Baker ( Land of the Dead) and the ultra hot Carla Gugino ( Sin City), along with a couple of partners. They kidnapped a hotshot computer mogul and they run his accountant all over town before they get the dough. Things go fast from there as new twists and turns are brought in. The whole thing is brilliant and definitely a "" piss in your pants because you can't go to the bathroom or you'll miss something "" thrill. Now, to be completely honest, I would have given this movie a 10 if there had been more of the movie the security guard was watching in the opening. I would have loved to see more of Beverly Hotsprings and Yvette Lera, but, hey, that wasn't part of the caper; just icing on the cake. Thompson and Rickman should definitely make more movies together. One treat: Agent Hawkins: So fill me in. Detective Friedman: That remark could be misconstrued as sexual harassment, Agent Hawkins. Agent Hawkins: Let's get it out of the way then: you've never worked under a female superior before. I got to where I am by pushing paper and playing niceI've never actually fired a gun before, I'm only in this job to prove to my father I'm not a coward. I give decent head, so I got promoted before all the worthy candidates, all of them men, all of them equally gifted at fellatio but there was a gender quota to fill. I'm also stupid and idealistic; you are hard and cynical, and usually right. I am secretly in love with you but I have a hard time showing it. Did I skip anything? Damn, that's great dialog! Gutierrez not only directs a great movie, but he can write too! And, did I say Carla Gugino was hot? Put this on your list."

0,"This, ladies and gentlemen, is truly a modern Bmovie. The dialog is stilted and delivered with wooden rigidity, the premise is predictable ( there are a few decent twists) and characters remain 2D for most of it. And yet there is a certain ... charm. WWE wrestler Kane brings to life the sick, twisted monster of a man with a lot of pathos ( though it is somewhat like his character that he's been playing around ten years) and so I'll find it quite amusing when people say it's "" not much of a reach for him, "" but Glen Jacobs is, apparently, quite the nice guy, so actually it is. In any event, he's cast perfectly as the hulking brute and the deaths are suitably over the top ( Jason would be proud), but I heard at least four applause breaks for four different kills scenes. Frankly go into this movie thinking that you'll have some fun and a gorefest, oh it is QUITE the gorefest. The Rrating IS richly deserved and I actually got a little nauseous during some of the more graphic times. In any event, a very, very fun, but fairly bad, movie."

0,"To be brief, the story is paper thin and you can see the ending coming from a mile away, but Gene Kelly, Rita Hayworth, and an impossibly young Phil Silvers keep the movie afloat throughout and at times lift it right up into the air. A few of the songs are terrible clunkers ( "" Poor John "" is a train wreck) but most of them are great fun, and the scene of Hayworth performing on the absurdly huge set for Kelly's rival has to be seen to be believed. Another treat is the perfect fauxNYC sets in the best Hollywood tradition. Another attraction, if you consider such things attractions, is the howlingly awful male "" chivalry "" toward women. The oily leering and transparent obsequiousness that passed for male charm back then ( in the movies, at least) is presented in its most lurid form here. Some of the men are about like a cartoon wolf. One minor disappointment is Eve Arden trapped in a role so minor that she barely has a chance to do anything. I can imagine a lot of potential comic interplay between her and Silvers -- a missed opportunity."

But the scenes WITH Spacey are just so entertaining that you hang on in there right to the end. Yes, he could play this part in his sleep but he does it so well, he's such a joy to watch, so believable and marvellously monstrous. Enjoy it for his performance, but don't expect anything else from this movie. If you want to see a great film about the evils of modern Hollywood, check out Robert Altman's "" The Player "".

Of course one could make the argument that this reworking business has never left us, for success in the Movies or TV always leads to a trend; with all competing parties vying to come up with their own version of said hit Movie or TV Program. TO this last premise we strongly disagree; for this is copycatting or plagiarism, plain and simple. THIS, the last Silent Laurel & Hardy Short, surely must have been quite well received; for ANGORA LOVE ( Hal Roach/ MGM, 1929) was reworked on the Roach Lot, not once, but twice over the next three years. We were treated to LAUGHING GRAVY ( Roach/ MGM, 1931), in which the Goat was replaced with a cute, little puppydog. Also, the weather is transformed into the dead of Winter, in the middle of a blizzard. They also made other lineup changes with substituting Landlord Edgar Kennedy with Landlord Charlie Hall. THE second reworking of the hidden animal premise is the 3 Reeler, THE CHIMP ( Roach/ MGM, 1932), which substituted a female ape from a dissolved and defunct Circus, to which Stan and Babe were former employees. The Circus paid off its employees with their assets and the Boys received the Chimpanzee as their final payday. BACK to our original ' victim ', today's subject, ANGORA LOVE. Recomember? THE short starts off simply enough. The boys encounter the Goat on the street and the Nanny in return follows them back to their rooming house; after Stan feeds a doughnut to her. The comic moments that follow are generated with the interplay between L & H and slowburn exponent, Edgar Kennedy, their Landlord. The incident's impact is amplified by having the interplay occur at night. And as luck would have it; their room is situated directly above the Landlord's quarters. IN addition to the noise, the bathing of the goat, its odor and Landlord Edgar's suspicions about Laurel & Hardy's having another person illegally in the room; we were most amused by a little throwaway gag, which may well have been missed by the Censors. While admonishing the boys about the noise they'd been making and reminding them of the house rules about any unauthorized person's being in there overnight, regardless of their sex. ITS camera shot is made from inside The Boy's room, over their shoulder. With Edgar in the hall and facing them, he warns; "" Remember, this is a respectable establishment! "" Just as he says this, a lady clad in evening clothes walks across and behind the Landlord; followed by a uniformed Sailor, who cocks his hat forward as they pass! POODLE SCHNITZ!!"

0,"Watching Showtime I got the impression that the producers got the idea to put Robert DeNiro and Eddie Murphy just for the sake of having a film that costarred the two of them. Other than that I can't think of a reason to justify the film's existence. Not that it isn't amusing in spots, it certainly is, but the concept is so completely ludicrous that the laughs are somewhat muted. The thing that really got me was Eddie Murphy's character. I can't seem to wrap my mind around the concept of someone being a police officer as strictly a day job. When I was working person at New York State Crime Victims Board I had to deal with all kinds of cops and they ran the gamut between the really dedicated and some real slugs, but I can't think of one who thought that this was just something I do until I get my career going in an area far afield. I mean, can you really see Eddie Murphy or anyone else going through the rigors of the real Police Academy, not the screen version, just to get a day job? Anyway DeNiro is your basic hard working detective who's on the trail of a major gun dealer. He's undercover and Murphy is part of his backup. So what does the showboating Murphy do, he calls a reality based TV series like COPS to film the action.   So DeNiro's bust gets blown sky high, but the producer of the show gets some good footage of Murphy and DeNiro and decides on a new reality based television series. So these unwilling partners get joined and try to continue working DeNiro's case with all the TV cameras around. Eddie Murphy's a funny guy, I loved him in Beverly Hills Cop and in the Doctor Doolittle movies, but he's done better things than Showtime and Robert DeNiro certainly has.   I guess Murphy wanted a chance to work with DeNiro and DeNiro must have gotten one hefty paycheck to do this film."

0,"Well, I have to say, this movie was probably the funniest movie I have seen all year. And I don't exactly mean that in a good way. This is probably the most pathetic movie I have seen in a while, and yet that's what makes it so hilarious. you can tell these people are really trying to act, unfortunately for them they aren't doing such a good job, making it so even lines delivered in what is supposed to be a serious tone come out sounding really funny. Aaron Carter is essentially playing a character quite similar to himself in real life, and still he manages to make the character seem corny and not at all realistic. This movie is one of those movies where everything that is supposed to sound serious comes out really funny and all the things that are supposed to be funny are just so stupid and corny that you have to laugh because you know how hard they are trying. This movie is so bad, it's actually good. I would definitely recommend it if your in the mood for a good laugh."

After voting for the ratings for this film I saw the statistics. Apparently this film appeals most to under 18 girls. No wonder. They didn't pay enough to Charlize to flash and I guess some girls magazine has rated Mark Wahlbergs abs "" AWESOME "". Other than that this film is completely predictable, the actors are mainly forever Bstars and even the good ones are being misused horribly, the film is filled with obvious product placement and imagine this: it even manages to repeat itself without doing a sequel! The first 15 minutes are the best part of the film and it's all downhill from there and once they figured this out they decided to use the finest hour again in the end repeatingtodetail their gold heist. All in all, lots of noise about nothing. I think Charlize Theron is good and Ed Norton could be more as he's been before. Apart from Donald Sutherland's "" look, I'm here too "" appearing in the beginning I'd say this movie ought to have a "" pass if you're above 18 "" all over it."

All in all, lots of noise about nothing. I think Charlize Theron is good and Ed Norton could be more as he's been before. Apart from Donald Sutherland's "" look, I'm here too "" appearing in the beginning I'd say this movie ought to have a "" pass if you're above 18 "" all over it."
0,"What a fine film! Unfortunately, being 1947, the movie script couldn't have followed the book from which it was adapted, but the murder of a homosexual would have been too hot to handle in that era. I thought all of the performances were outstanding, as well as the script, direction, brilliant black and white cinematography, music and film noir atmosphere. I do understand that in 1947 the film couldn't portray racism against blacks or prejudice against homosexuals. ( Robert Young's account of prejudice against his grandfather who was Irish and who endured this racism 100 years ago was pretty lame, but the times dictated that the film avoid a further examination of racism.)   I do have one observation and one question to ask the viewer: 1. Did you notice that Robert Young didn't aim his gun when he shot and killed Robert Ryan who was running fast in the dark and Young shot from an upper story window into the dark without aiming? 2. If Robert Young's grandfather was killed 100 years ago in 1847 ( the film was made in 1947) and Young was 40 years old, the time line would not be logical. If the grandfather had been killed 50 years ago then the time frame would be realistic."

1,"What a surprise this film was. I've seen a good few of Fulci's horror and zombie flicks and was amazed that this was by the same director. He also wrote the screen play which shows that the chap was quite capable of crafting a detailed, complex story line. The dubbing on this is not good, but far from the appalling slop that only further hinders later howlers like ' Manhattan Baby '. The photography in this film is fantastic. A strange, almost futuristic highway appears throughout the film which focuses on a small town where young boys are being murdered. A scene involving the beating of a woman is uncomfortable to watch, yet refreshing in comparison to usual cinema violence.   What went wrong Lucio? Perhaps there is a strong case to suggest he had reached his peak with this film, and it slowly went downhill after that."

Also, is he supposed to be an abortion? Strange. Very strange. This movie will mess with your mind, ... and it's not very scary, ... just confusing. Why was he, ... Where did, ...

1,"When I first saw this movie, I said to myself, "" Hey what the heck it sounds like a good movie, why not rent it? "". So yeah, I rented it and went back home to see it. When I inserted it in my DVD player I was shocked. Well FIRST of all, no one told me it was a Mexican movie and was spoken in Spanish, good thing it had subtitles. SECOND, it was nude, nude NUDE! Since I have no background whatsoever in Mexican movies, you could see my shock when I saw it.* GASP! Covering virgin eyes, NOO* THIRD, predictable to say the least, but actually being it predictable was no excuse to me in liking movies, because I don't seem to care if it's predictable, unless it's way over the top.   FOURTH, how Heidi and Kike were reunited, so cheesy.   FIFTH, how the movie ended. It was a BAD, BAD ending. How Mr. Van der Linde's sudden approval to the mayor's election was because her daughter, knew how to throw the party ... BLAH, Blah. I was hoping that he wasn't that easy to accept it, the director might have just rushed it.   After all of this bashing of the bad stuff, the good stuff's are here to come. The movie was actually quite hilarious at some point with Maribel being clumsy in the kitchen and all, Heidi's attitude, Valentina being poetic with words. What I really also like about it was the song that Valentina made with her girl friend. That's all, and for the other stuffs that I haven't mentioned they were just soso."

0,"When I started watching this, I instantly noticed that I couldn't understand what anyone was saying. I turned up the volume. With background noises now booming out, I could hear the voices. Just what are the actors saying? Is the movie not dubbed? Are they speaking Spanish? After some confusion, I realize that it was English. At least, I think so ... The Amazing Jess Franco has placed the microphones too far away from the actors. As a result, we can not completely hear what they are saying. He's done this before. But maybe this is Mr. Franco's intention? By not knowing what people are saying, we are thrown into some mystery about what is going on, and are left with more visual clues ... Maybe it's just me, but I would have liked to know what was going on! How about a few hints? The basic premise ( I refuse to call it a "" plot "") concerns a young American exotic dancer named Paula ( played by Amber Newman) who has a boyfriend who gets her invited to a small island owned by some sleazy rich people. It is somewhere off the coast of Spain. For this visit, a large cash payment is promised to Paula, which the boyfriend gets. He then escapes from the island, only to return later. Why? Pay close attention to the scene where the boyfriend opens Paula's US passport. Though his hand tried to cover it up, you can see the actress ' REAL name, Amber Newman, printed below the photo on the bottom of the passport!! Anyway, back to the "" story "": There are some other sleazy, rich, beautiful characters visiting the island, all with ambiguous motives. We witness sadistic games ( are they real or fake?) and unappealing dining scenes. But the food must be good, as a phony French chef prepared it! There is a young woman servant who runs around naked and never speaks. Is she really mute? And do we care? Of course all the women are mostly naked throughout this film ... Oh well, we can at least be thankful that the ( 50 + and overweight) men remain clothed! In addition to the abysmal sound quality, what I have always marveled at about Jess Franco is his amazing ability to film beautiful naked women in such a way that leaves the viewer completely turned off. This film is no exception   I needed fresh air after watching it!   In conclusion: I am happy to report that regardless of what Mr. Franco can dream up, I am still attracted to women."

0,"While everyone does a decent job in this film, I agree with the other comment: it's too loose and scattered, too much like a scriptless experiment with really talented actors. As such, it isn't enough to hold your attention. Having said that, there are a few really funny moments, one involving Dylan McDermott and a flaming shot glass that I think anyone who's been that drunk would find as funny as I did; the other is a splitsecond with an inflatable dinosaur. Crispin Glover does his usual nutty twitchfest guy and does it fine, Harry Dean Stanton does his usual nutty patriarch ( Repo Man, anyone?) etc. Good cast, not enough to keep it going. Just a few gems, seconds long."

1,"Why Jessie Matthews, one of Britains top musical stars, was in this movie in between her sparkling "" The Good Companions "" and the classic "" Evergreen "" is a good question? When I first saw it I was really disappointed. I wanted to see her sing and danceshe was billed as "" Milliethe nonstop variety girl "" but there was more stop than variety. Now I see it as a good little drama. It is about a bus crash and the stories, leading up to it, of the people on the bus. Apart from Jessie Matthews, who is great as MillieSir Ralph Richardson plays her fiance ( yes, that's right). Edmund Gwennwho went to Hollywood to costar in Lassie movies and also with Natalie Wood in "" Miracle on 34th Street "", plays a grumpy businessman. Gordon Harker is his very annoying partner. Emlyn Williamswho wrote "" Night Must Fall "" was the blackmailing villain and Frank Lawton, who went to Hollywood and appeared in "" David Copperfield "" and "" The Devil Doll "" is the young man in trouble. Sonnie Hale who was married to Jessie Matthews at the time played the bus conductor."

0,"You know you're watching softcore with the wrong attitude when the poor dubbing bothers you. I'm okay with the crappy lip syncing but the sound mix is really of too. Every time someone says anything it sounds like there's a narrator. Either way, this is pretty much the purgatory between boring French professionalism and the heavenly campy Joe D'Amato flicks involving cannibalism and whatnot. Don't get me wrong, there's a fair dose of exploitation in this one, but there's always room for more. Laura Gemser stars, and that's good because she's hot. It's a bit freaky how at times you can see her bone structure, but she still rules over her white counterpart. You can also make a cool drinking game of how often she takes her kit of. Often. Every reason is good. Every person is good. Every location is good. One scene even involves an entire hockey team, whatever they are doing in Africa. Sometimes the plot gets in the way, and the supporting cast consists of some really vile looking people, but there's enough Laura Gemser for all."

So if you look for a moment of escaping your life, watching this movie makes it worse because Sandra's life is a mess ....

1,"i consider this movie as one of the most interesting and funny movies of all time. It has so much highly intelligent thoughts in it, that anybody who thinks the movie is awful did not get it and is not able to recognize really deep philosophical themes, which are in it ( in all the 3 Schneider movies) without a doubt. Several universities in germany and throughout europe have made studies on Schneider's way of seeing things. By the way, Helge Schneider is a very intelligent and sensitive person and on of the Jazzmusicions in germany ( maybe europe). He is mostly inspired by the great M.Davis and T.Monk. So if you do not like him, it is ok, but please do not try to convince others that he might be stupid, cheap, boring or not funny. Because if you had to face this opinion in a discussion and if you are willing to really look into the art of H.Schneider you would have to "" surrender ""."

Dylan thomas is not the hero as sadly he was not throughout his life and neither really are the so called ' feisty woman ' of the pr spiel. it is cillian the william of the movie. a man that leaves the woman he loves to fight a war that they ignore. his challenge to reoonnect with that indifference is what is of real interest to this film and what a beautiful performance from that actor. i thiink this film is underrated because it was marketed so badly. Dylan thomas fans will expect something more from their so very flawed hero and get less, and well that is how it was marketed. it is not a film about Dylan thomas and it is much more interesting for it."

Davies is working as a chorus girl in New York when she gets the news that "" daddy "" wants her. Hmmmm, sounds familiar. Davies ' considerable talents as a comedienne save this otherwise soso comedy as she upsets the staid British countryside with her brazen American personality. Not as sharp as some other Davies comedies, but still worth a look. Ray Milland plays her longlost "" brother. "" Doris Lloyd, Elizabeth Murray, and Halliwell Hobbes are all fun, too."
1,yes barney is nonsense now but when i was a kid it made perfect sense. i haven't gotten any smarter but i enjoyed it. as a child i was mocked because no one could say my name so i changed it. ever since i was 4 I've gone by the name Tina from barney because i could relate to her being from a different culture. i'm 17 now and barney is a huge part of my life. ... my name came from it .... i ca nt dis the show i grew up with no matter how stupid it seems now. i don't care if i get blocked i have nothing more to say. they shouldn't make the minimum 10 lines because some people just don't have much to say. OK done
