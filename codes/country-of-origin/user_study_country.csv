0,"*** SPOILERS****** SPOILERS*** There's not much that can be said about this earlytalkie era flick. ( I'm hesitant to call "" Cimarron "" a "" film "", because I feel that the word is too esoteric.) But what can be said about it ... mainly speaks against it. Take, for example, the overuse of portraying Indians as bad folk. In one scene, the little boy of the flick's lead character -- an overbearing and overambitious family man who wants to set up a newspaper business-- is playing just outside of his father's office. An Indian kneels down in front of the child. "" Hello, "" the boy says to the Indian, in a very polite manner. The Indian gives him a feather, stands up and walks off. Yancy Cravat, Jr. excitedly runs inside the office. "" Mommy! Mommy! "" he shouts, holding up the Indian's gift. "" Look what an Indian gave me! "" "" How many times do I have to tell you! "" she snaps at the boy. "" You aren't ever to talk to those filthy Indians! "" Yancy Yates, Sr. ( Richard Dix) comes across as a man who speaks with a forked tongue. At the start of the story, he seems to have a definite plan for giving his family a better life. But, we soon enough discover, he's no great over achiever -- much less a totally goodmoral minded man. His slave child, Isaiah ( Eugene Jackson) is one telltale sign of this. Upon his family's first trek to a Sunday morning church service -- one at which, curiously enough, Cravat is to give the sermon -- Isaiah tries to come along, dressed up like Cravat, longtail suit, holster, gun and all. Cravat tells him to go home. "" Ya ' all doesn't want me to come with ya ' ta church? "" Isaiah says with a pout. "" No! "" Cravat corrects him, patting him on the shoulder. "" You don't understand! I want you to stay and guard the house. And if anyone at all comes along ... you shoot him dead! "" The characters -- not to mention the actors -- in "" Cimarron "" couldn't act their way out of burlap sacks, despite their obvious efforts. And nothing in the script was any too commendable, either. ( Granted: the incomparable Edna May Oliver -- notorious for playing the Red Queen in Alice In Wonderland, also released in 1931-actually manages to look good, pulling off her portrayal of a pompous old woman, which is what she's also been bestknown for.) But, aside from that, well ... Yancy Yates isn't popular in town from the first week he arrives, and one of the outlaws decides to shoot Cravat's white hat off as he and his wife ( Irene Dunne) are casually walking by. Despite her anger with the man who fired the bullet, Cravat just takes it completely in stride. Not only was this story not "" shooting for realism "", but it was very lacking in several key areas: e.g., Cravat's newspaper isn't ever really seen. ( Bulletins and posters, yes -- but not any newspaper.) Perhaps strangest of all, though: this is set in a small town in Kansas. Yet, for some reason or other, Yancy Cravat is deadset on calling his paper "" The Oklahoma WigWam. "" Really good westerns have always been very few and far between -- the only exceptions being Clint Eastwood's socalled "" spaghetti westerns "" of the late ' 60s to early ' 70s. Cliche westerns, on the other hand, are a dimeadozen. If you like cliche westerns, "" Cimarron "" will do you proud -- but, as for me ... it did me embarrassment."

3,"That distinction has to go to THE DUNGEON OF HARROW. At least Ed Wood's misguided attempt at making a quality science fiction film had the dubious "" star "" power of Bela Lugusi, Vampira, Tor Johnson, Criswell and Lyle Talbot. THE DUNGEON OF HARROW has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. What could have been an interesting and suspenseful plot about a marooned aristocrat on a leper colony, perhaps in the style of THE ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU or MYSTERIOUS ISLAND, is trashed by the heavy dialog and mono tonal acting of amateurs whose lines sink like lead weights into a sea of stupidity. The "" special effects "", which took place in someone's bathtub, further doom this film to the dung heap. Even the treatment of leprosy is something out of a Victorian interpretation of the Bible. The fact that leprosy can not be contracted from an individual in its last stages belies the plot line that the aristocrat Fallon and his lady, Cassandra contract the disease and end up as the original occupants of the Castle De Sade, doomed to insanity and inhuman cruelty. It is interesting to note that not one member of the cast made another film. No wonder, talent begets talent; lack of talent begets oblivion, which is where this film should find its deplorable end."

6,"A wealthy young man, raised as a SON OF THE GODS, must confront his Chinese heritage while living in a White world. Although the premise upon which this film is based is almost certainly a biological impossibility and the secret of the plot when revealed at the movie's conclusion makes all which has preceded it faintly ludicrous, the story still serves up some decent entertainment and good acting. Richard Barthelmess has the title role as the sweetnatured Oriental whose life is terribly complicated because he looks Caucasian. Barthelmess keeps the tone of his performance serious throughout, gazing intently into the middle distance ( a mannerism he developed during Silent Days) whenever his character is indecently misused. He makes no attempt to replicate his classic performance in D. W. Griffith's BROKEN BLOSSOMS ( 1919) and this is to his credit. Beautiful Constance Bennett is the millionaire's daughter who makes Barthelmess miserable. She is gorgeous as always, but her behavior does not endear her to the viewer and her terrible illness in the final reel is kept mercifully off screen. Multitalented Frank Albertson has a small role as Barthelmess ' improvident buddy. Serene E. Alyn Warren and blustery Anders Randolf play the leading stars ' very different fathers, while Claude King distinguishes his brief appearance as the English author who befriends Barthelmess. Movie mavens will recognize little Dickie Moore, uncredited, playing Barthelmess as a tiny child. The original Technicolor of the flashback sequence has faded with time to a ruddy tint. The shot purporting to be the South of France instead looks suspiciously like Avalon on Santa Catalina Island, off the coast of Southern California."

9,"Spike Milligan was one of the funniest men I've ever seen, and a huge influence on my life. This movie is limp and awful, and does his memory no credit. The script is cluttered and preserves too many lines from the book intact ( the leg jokes here are incomprehensible). The actors ' performances are uniformly ineffective, a great cast wasted, and the lead, Sean Hughes, delivers Milligan's belligerent hostilities in a plaintive whine, which misses the point completely. The gentle pacing is a killer as well. Farce should accelerate towards the end. The Goon Shows often did, the novel "" Puckoon "" definitely did, but this film, if anything, slows down just when you want the various elements to smash together in a final climax. Milligan narrated an abridged audio recording of "" Puckoon "" in 1980, with T.P. McKenna, Dermot Kelly, Norma Ronald and Jack Hobbs. Now, that's funny. Ten minutes of that is funnier than this whole film. I believe the LP was transferred to CD, but don't know if it's still in print. There is a movie of "" Adolf Hitler: My Part in his Downfall "" with Jim Dale and Arthur Lowe. It too is a godawful mess, but it's funnier than this thing. It's possible that Milligan's spirit is too rambunctious for the screen. The other reviewers here are indulging in politeness and wishful thinking. This film fumbles virtually every opportunity and never misses a chance to disappoint."

15,"I was quite impressed with this movie as a child of eight or nine. The gangsters seemed very real and threatening to me, and I could see why people would have been afraid of someone like Dillinger. Seeing it as an adult, it seemed almost comical, owing to the overdone narration and jarring details like Thirties gangsters driving cars that looked like they were from the Fifties. There is a certain gritty, unglamorous reality to the way the criminals are portrayed, but the overall effect is more like a bad soap opera. The most memorable and most unintentionally funny bit that sticks with me is the scene where Ma Barker and her sons are shooting it out with the FBI and the sons are killed. The narrator says something like "" Perhaps in that moment, for the only time in her life, Ma Barker became a real mother "". This is meant to be a moment of great tragedy and pathos, as Ma finally realizes how she's destroyed her family out of her own greed, but instead, it provokes laughter. A very odd film that is rarely shown anywhere these days. Gangster movie buffs might enjoy it, but more as a curiosity than a real movie."

The first really bad thing is the guy hijacking Steven Seagal would have been beaten to pulp by Seagal's driving, but that probably would have ended the whole premise for the movie. It seems like they decided to make all kinds of changes in the movie plot, so just plan to enjoy the action, and do not expect a coherent plot.

24,"Earth has been destroyed in a nuclear holocaust. Well, parts of the Earth, because somewhere in Italy, a band of purebred survivors -- those without radioactive contamination -- are holed up in a massive mansion surrounded by lush grounds, waiting for the next opportunity to go hunting for those with polluted blood. The Final Executioner is the story of one of their would be victims, Alan ( William Mang, who looks, not surprisingly, a lot like Kurt Russell), and his efforts to take down the legally sanctioned hunters, who are led by Edra ( Marina Costa) and Erasmus ( Harrison Muller Jr.). Alan has been trained to kill by former NYPD cop Sam ( Woody Strode) who mostly hangs around giving his pupil moral support and mooching for tinned meat.

27,"Every movie Quentin Tarantino has made has become progressively worse. I'd like to believe that most people would agree with that statement, but seeing as "" Inglourious(sic) Basterds(sic) "" has an 8.5/10 from over 100,000 ratings, it doesn't seem like the general moviegoing public has any sense. Even his best work, Reservoir Dogs, wasn't a ' masterpiece. ' The trouble is that claiming that you like Tarantino's work has become trendy. As soon as that happens, you get boatloads of people ready and willing to hop on another bandwagon. They will ignore laughably terrible acting, and utterly selfindulgent writing just so they can be part of the exclusive club called "" everyone. "" This movie is so terrible, that I swear it must be some sort of twisted joke by Tarantino to see how much torture his fans will tolerate and still praise him. Like another reviewer has already said: "" Previous Tarantino movies were from a guy in love with other movies. This one is from a guy in love with his own writing. "" I couldn't agree more.

30,"Perhaps this movie is a little too long, but it still has some charm 45 years later. The main roles seem more appropriate for Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh. I could care less about Gary Cooper, but Ingrid Bergman is fine, particularly in dark hair. The movie is worth seeing for the supporting cast: Flora Robson is terrific as a mulatto servant. She is a white woman in blackface, and can have an expression of evil or of a voodoo mistress. Jerry Austin as a servant dwarf has a delightful role, that keeps you chuckling despite some overlong scenes. Speaking of scenes, Florence Bates steals most of the ones she is in as a dowager social lady. I didn't understand the outcome of the railroad fight at the end of the movie, and the last scene was pure Hollywood dreck. It's an odd feeling when you realize the film title refers to a railroad rather than a piece of luggage!"

"" The best part of the documentary is the home movies of Cooper and his family as well as his childhood photos, showing him as a beautiful blonde kid with the sunny smile he would have his entire life. There is also a hilarious clip of Cooper on "" The Jack Benny Show "" doing the comeback on the number "" Bird Dog ""and Benny loses it. The documentary also takes us briefly through his tumultuous affair with Patricia Neal, which nearly ruined both their lives. There's a certain cohesiveness missing from this bio/ retrospectiveit jumps around a lot and has no footage of Cooper being interviewed, which would have added a lot. Also, Clint Eastwood's narration was described as unobtrusive. What it was, was boring and monotone. Given that Cooper himself tended to be the strong, silent type on screen, we could have used a little animation. On a personal note, Gary Cooper was one of the handsomest men who ever livedthere were some looks at him in his early films, but not nearly enough for this fan.

36,"Well, how to start? I saw The Italian Job for the first time some years ago and visiting a rental shop I couldn't quite remember why I had a bad feeling about it. Now I do. After voting for the ratings for this film I saw the statistics. Apparently this film appeals most to under 18 girls. No wonder. They didn't pay enough to Charlize to flash and I guess some girls magazine has rated Mark Wahlbergs abs "" AWESOME "". Other than that this film is completely predictable, the actors are mainly forever Bstars and even the good ones are being misused horribly, the film is filled with obvious product placement and imagine this: it even manages to repeat itself without doing a sequel! The first 15 minutes are the best part of the film and it's all downhill from there and once they figured this out they decided to use the finest hour again in the end repeatingtodetail their gold heist.

39,"Man with the Screaming Brain is a story of greed, betrayal and revenge in the a small Bulgarian town. William Cole, wealthy industrialist, winds up with part of his brain replaced by that of a Russian cab driver Yegor. The two couldn't be more different, but they share one thingboth were killed by the same woman. Brought back to life by a mad scientist, William and Yegor form an unlikely partnership to track down their common nemesis. Bruce Campbell returns to the B horror movie genre that gave him his cult status, this time not only in front of the screen, but behind the lens. Unfortunately for this time around, the laughs don't deliver and Campbell has to resort to what he does best to try and fill the gap in this film. As a fan of Campbell, who has the movies, the books and the action figures, I was hoping for another hit to add to my collection. Although, after seeing this film before the purchase, I am glad that I don't have the "" pleasure "" of adding it. The film first goes wrong in the story, which at first sight, seems like harmless fun but turns out to be boring drawn out dribble. Which is a sad thing to say because it was written by Mr. Campbell himself. The comedy never really hits, it only makes us scratch our heads. It seems that Campbell ran out of things that are funny and resulted in giving the audience what we've already seen ... him fighting himself. Ted Raimi, the brother of Evil Dead director Sam Raimi, is undoubtedly the highlight of the film. He brings a freshness to it and an entertaining time when the film really needs it. It helps if you are a fan and have been following these stooges from Evil Dead to Xena, which is why I felt compelled to like this film. Campbell's experience as a director, from directing episodes of the TV series Hercules is apparent. Campbell makes the film work well enough, even with the lowbudget. In the end, there aren't as many things going for this as one would hope for, but the fans of Campbell will stick behind it no matter what, unfortunately for this fan ... I won't."

50,"I have to admit that when first saw Waltruda performing Holiday on Top of the Pops many years ago I said to my wife "" another American one hit wonder getting the whole thing wrong!! "" Well she was wearing a fright wig and was appallingly dressed. I have never grown to love her the way my daughter does but I have to eat my words. I do like some of her stuff and sometimes enjoy her filmed concerts. This Confessions tour film is great, even if the music is not(and its not). I was impressed by the staging and concepts.

54,"A young woman, Jodie Foster, is witnessing a mafia murder, reports the killing to the local police, and becomes herself a hit target by the mob operatives. A professional killer, Dennis Hopper, hired by mafia, is stalking her to prepare for the hit, but eventually he falls for her. Then, as a parody of the Stockholm Syndrome that defines a case when an abducted hostage begins to like and cooperate with the kidnapper, Jodie Foster falls for her abductor too, make love, and both prepare for a getaway. Denis Hopper, the actor, tries to align himself with the creative ambitions of Dennis Hopper, the director. The result is disappointing, and fails to keep pace with the artistic level of a great performer as Dennis Hopper is. There is no real thrill and the script is sometimes naive and predictable. The film is saved to some extent by the performance of Jodie Foster who is not at her best, but still shines with her talent, beauty and gift. Of historical interest is the short appearance of Vincent Price, and, in a small act, of Charlie Sawn known from his great part in "" Wall Street "". If you decide to spend the 116 minutes to see the film, it is not a complete loss; this movie offers easy entertainment, but we would expect much more from the director of "" Easy Rider "", and the actress who gave us the character of Sarah Tobias in "" The Accused ""."

57,"Pitch Black is a survival story. It's about how to survive in an hostile, alien world against even more hostile enemies. The task gets even more difficult when the nearest enemies can be found within your own surviving group. The plot of Pitch Black is quite usual and has been seen several times before in different variations. But what makes this movie shine above others, is it's wellwritten characters. The group consists of very different people with few more interesting than the others: Jack, a boy with a secret; Fry, a pilot having hard time with her own conscience; Johns, a bounty- hunter with a drughabit; Imam, a holy man facing the fact that God is sometimes cruel and Riddick, a convict and a murderer learning to value others, not only himself. Characters start to live in the movie. They aren't only paper like in many other movies of this genre. You start to care for the characters, especially for Riddick though that feels quite odd. He is supposed to be the bad guy. In this movie, the line between light and pitch black is very thin. All characters are familiar with both. Other thing that works in this movie is the casting. Rarely do actors fit to their roles this well. Radha Mitchell is suitable for Fry. Cole Hauser brings the right amount of cruelness and sense of responsibility for Johns. But the most impressive work is done by Vin Diesel. He does great job as Riddick. In his hands Riddick is quite creepy, definitely very dangerous and also deep character, just as he is supposed to be. So, how do you survive in Pitch Black? Keep your friends close and enemies even closer."

They didn't pay enough to Charlize to flash and I guess some girls magazine has rated Mark Wahlbergs abs "" AWESOME "". Other than that this film is completely predictable, the actors are mainly forever Bstars and even the good ones are being misused horribly, the film is filled with obvious product placement and imagine this: it even manages to repeat itself without doing a sequel! The first 15 minutes are the best part of the film and it's all downhill from there and once they figured this out they decided to use the finest hour again in the end repeatingtodetail their gold heist.

I had some bad echoes about it, but in the end, I wasn't so disappointed: the story, though classical, is kind of interesting and must have been really new back in the days when it was released in theatres. I was gladly surprised when I figured out that contrary to what we usually see, computerperformed actions are somehow realistic, as they use Windows 3.x and normal computers. The storytelling is median and not bothering the viewer. The end is typically American. The actors ' performance is globally OK, Sandra Bullock usually annoys me with her "" oh my god why me "" way to behave, but this time she seems to have controlled herself. I'd recommend that movie."

72,"I saw the movie in original Italian.

A few drops in style could be spared to the public, such as the patisserie drag ( Charm and aesthetics of cooking plus sensual payload of sweets, see Chocolat, Babette's lunch, Vatel etc.) Hammam and the Fairies are definitely more truthful, seems that Ozpetek has learned the tune of Italy in the early 2000s and is humming along ...

The film revolves around impersonation ( which seems to be in the curriculum of every comic star!)in this case a German officerand, while not as bad as Leonard Maltin claims ( awarding it a BOMB rating), it's not exactly classic stuff eithercertainly leagues behind Chaplin's THE GREAT DICTATOR ( 1940), even if comparably narcissistic!

84,"I saw Bogard when it was released in the 70s. It was one of those pictures that received an X rating for violence. We snuck into our local grindhouse, and saw it anyway. Pretty good picture. Lots of blood from the street fights, although the cheap sound effects for the punches took something away from it. And lots of sex. I remember one of the early scenes when Bogard meets this pretty brunette in an apartment she is showing him. Without saying a word, he picks her up, puts her in the windowsill and nails her. From what I remember the picture sailed from that point on. So, when I found out Bogart is also called Black Fist and was available on VHS, I ordered it online. I was very disappointed. Black Fist is Bogard edited for television. So many of the scenes I remember were missing, I wondered if indeed, this was the same picture."

93,"As a local performer, I thought that "" Grease "" showcased what Broadway producers are looking for and it highlighted a small bit of the acting population.

The two couldn't be more different, but they share one thingboth were killed by the same woman. Brought back to life by a mad scientist, William and Yegor form an unlikely partnership to track down their common nemesis. Bruce Campbell returns to the B horror movie genre that gave him his cult status, this time not only in front of the screen, but behind the lens. Unfortunately for this time around, the laughs don't deliver and Campbell has to resort to what he does best to try and fill the gap in this film. As a fan of Campbell, who has the movies, the books and the action figures, I was hoping for another hit to add to my collection. Although, after seeing this film before the purchase, I am glad that I don't have the "" pleasure "" of adding it. The film first goes wrong in the story, which at first sight, seems like harmless fun but turns out to be boring drawn out dribble. Which is a sad thing to say because it was written by Mr. Campbell himself. The comedy never really hits, it only makes us scratch our heads. It seems that Campbell ran out of things that are funny and resulted in giving the audience what we've already seen ... him fighting himself. Ted Raimi, the brother of Evil Dead director Sam Raimi, is undoubtedly the highlight of the film. He brings a freshness to it and an entertaining time when the film really needs it. It helps if you are a fan and have been following these stooges from Evil Dead to Xena, which is why I felt compelled to like this film. Campbell's experience as a director, from directing episodes of the TV series Hercules is apparent. Campbell makes the film work well enough, even with the lowbudget. In the end, there aren't as many things going for this as one would hope for, but the fans of Campbell will stick behind it no matter what, unfortunately for this fan ... I won't."

108,"I was quite impressed with this movie as a child of eight or nine. The gangsters seemed very real and threatening to me, and I could see why people would have been afraid of someone like Dillinger. Seeing it as an adult, it seemed almost comical, owing to the overdone narration and jarring details like Thirties gangsters driving cars that looked like they were from the Fifties. There is a certain gritty, unglamorous reality to the way the criminals are portrayed, but the overall effect is more like a bad soap opera. The most memorable and most unintentionally funny bit that sticks with me is the scene where Ma Barker and her sons are shooting it out with the FBI and the sons are killed. The narrator says something like "" Perhaps in that moment, for the only time in her life, Ma Barker became a real mother "". This is meant to be a moment of great tragedy and pathos, as Ma finally realizes how she's destroyed her family out of her own greed, but instead, it provokes laughter. A very odd film that is rarely shown anywhere these days. Gangster movie buffs might enjoy it, but more as a curiosity than a real movie."

114,"I guess it wasn't entirely the filmmaker's fault though. The film suffered from the unimaginably stupid decision to tell Clayton Moore ( who had done the role in the 1950's and was the Lone Ranger us old folks grew up with) he couldn't wear the mask in public. Now mind you, the poor guy wasn't making all that much money doing so, and it wasn't like he was going to take anything away from this film, but the whole thing seemed ... gratuitous. The other thing the film suffered from ( besides a leading man whose voice was so awful they had to overdub it) was that fact that Westerns weren't so hip in 1981. John Wayne was dead and we had just been subjected to a decadelong major liberal guilt trip about how the west was built on genocide of the Native Americans. ( That and Blazing Saddles sent up the whole genre! The Campfire scene. Enough said!) Hollywood shied away from Westerns, because Science Fiction was COOL then. The one scene that underscored it was when after rescuing the drunken President Grant ( and seriously, I'd have let Grant stay with the bad guys. The country would have been better off!) Grant asks Tonto what his reward should be "" Honor your treaties with my people "". Yeah, right, like THAT was going to happen!"

117,"Spoiler warning!!! This is probably my least favourite Cary Grant film. I spent most of the time thinking: ignore him, leave him etc. Is he trying to kill her? Should we assume that after the end, when he persuades her to return home with him, that he will kill her after all? I see from checking in a couple of books that this is a reading that some viewers/ critics have taken. Finishing early is after all a more reasonable way to film a book, than to change the endingand this is a more unreasonable change of ending than, for example, in Altman's The Long Goodbye. Unlike Hitchcock's earlier example of making the murderer not the murderer because a star has been cast ( when Gosford Park refers to The Lodger, Ivor Novello's murderous habits are not mentioned) the book's ending is not definitely ruled out. In Robin Wood's Hitchcock's Films Revisited, he writes: "" As one mentally ' swiches ' from ending to ending, the significance of every scene changes, the apparent solidity of the narrative dissolves, the illusion of the fiction's ' reality ' disintegrates, the film becomes a ' modernist ' text in which the process of narrative is foregrounded. "" I enjoy playing intellectual interpretation games as much as anyone else, but unless the film stands on a straightforward reading, then it fails. This one fails. Even after considering the fatal glasses of milk that recur in a few Hitchcock films. An annoying quibble. The year is 1941. Nothing in the film says that it is set in the past. Beaky ( Nigel Bruce) keeps his money in a Paris Bank, and goes there to do financial business? Does he not know that there is a war on? Indeed, were there still any flights from Croydon airport? Is he on good terms with the Nazis? How come it is never suggested that the Germans shot him as a spy or something. A curiosity. When Johnnie and Lina have dinner with Isobel, the mystery writer, and her brother, the pathologist, there is a fifth person present, who is never explained nor introduceda woman in a tuxedo. The credits say that she is Nondas Metcalf playing Phyllis Swinghurst. Is this not an example of how lesbians were coded in ' 40s films? Are we to take her as Isobel's lover? The books that discuss overt and hidden gays/ lesbians in Hitchcock ( e.g. Robin Wood again) do not include Phyllis Swinghurst."

Everythingthe script, screenplay, dialogues, song lyrics, directionshoddy, lousy. Saw this movie when I was a kid. Liked it then, mainly because it was a fantasy, a superheromovie. Its a notsoexplored genre in Hindi cinema. The attempt deserves credit, but that's all there is to it. Sashi Kapoor seems to have been in a great hurry in making the movie. Can't understand the reason behind casting foreigners as Hindispeaking characters, who can't even get the sync right ( nothing to say about the dubbing). The screenplay is terrible. The editing even more. If one follows the dialogues closely, one can detect grammaticallywrong sentences ( which completely alter the intended meaning). Nothing special about the music. The biggest embarrassment must be for the Censor board. There are a couple of nipslip scenes in the movie, one of which is absolutely clear ( so much so that I can't even think of a metaphor). The director missed them. The editing team missed it. And the censor board missed it too. So much for the noindecentexposureon screen motto. The officials probably fell asleep while watching the movie. Can't think of why Amitabh went with the role. It might be because he was a good friend of the Kapoors. But the role hardly has anything for him. With wonderful roles in Hum and Agneepath behind him, he couldn't have followed it up with a worse one. There are a couple of heroic scenes, really worthy ones. But otherwise, they're embarrassingly unbelievable ( arrowcatching for instance .. it probably could've been better with CGI, but it was ' 91 ..). Dimple and Sonam do not exactly set the screen on fire. Shammi Kapoor and Rishi Kapoor give an inspired performance, but their scope is limited. Amrish Puri is his usual self in the role of a fairytale villain ( letting out the villainous laugh every now and then). On the whole, an interesting concept. Could have been a lot more better."

135,"Chuck Jones's ' Odorable Kitty ' is the cartoon that introduced Pepe Le Pew to the world   sort of. There are a few key differences between the Pepe we know and love ( or hate, in the case of some people) and the character in this cartoon. For one, the disguised cat who Pepe amorously pursues in ' Odorable Kitty ' is distinctly male. Also, Pepe is exposed as a fraud whose real name is Henry at the cartoon's climax, his French accent dropping away when his wife and family turn up. Pepe is not even the lead character here, the focus favouring the putupon cat who disguises himself as a skunk to scare off his enemies. For the most part, the storyline largely follows the usual format of a Pepe Le Pew cartoon but Pepe's aggressive courtship is lacking the usual wisecracks and straight to camera addresses that make him such a great character. He is also not nearly as handsome as he would become and rather awkwardly animated. In fact, ' Odorable Kitty ' is a fairly ugly and clumsy looking cartoon all round. Its main source of appeal comes from its concept which was original at this stage before it became the template for every Pepe Le Pew cartoon that followed. This subsequent development has robbed ' Odorable Kitty ' of any impact whatsoever and to modern viewers it just looks like a rather dull Pepe Le Pew short with a weird surprise ending. As a child, I hated Pepe Le Pew. As an adult, able to appreciate his more sophisticated, verbal and risqu humour, I love the character and most of his cartoons. ' Odorable Kitty ' makes me feel like a child again!"

There are a few key differences between the Pepe we know and love ( or hate, in the case of some people) and the character in this cartoon. For one, the disguised cat who Albercik amorously pursues in ' Odorable Kitty ' is distinctly male. Also, Albercik is exposed as a fraud whose real name is Henry at the cartoon's climax, his French accent dropping away when his wife and family turn up.

Harrison Ford is being criticized for everything from his haircut to his earring and I really don't see what any of these things have to do with the film.

It is slower than the majority of his previous films but not worthy of the trashings it has received. I would gladly pay$ 7.50 just to watch a bald Harrison Ford mow his lawn."

147,"*** SPOILERS****** SPOILERS*** There's not much that can be said about this earlytalkie era flick. ( I'm hesitant to call "" Cimarron "" a "" film "", because I feel that the word is too esoteric.) But what can be said about it ... mainly speaks against it. Take, for example, the overuse of portraying Indians as bad folk. In one scene, the little boy of the flick's lead character -- an overbearing and overambitious family man who wants to set up a newspaper business-- is playing just outside of his father's office. An Indian kneels down in front of the child. "" Hello, "" the boy says to the Indian, in a very polite manner. The Indian gives him a feather, stands up and walks off. Yancy Cravat, Jr. excitedly runs inside the office. "" Mommy! Mommy! "" he shouts, holding up the Indian's gift. "" Look what an Indian gave me! "" "" How many times do I have to tell you! "" she snaps at the boy. "" You aren't ever to talk to those filthy Indians! "" Yancy Yates, Sr. ( Richard Dix) comes across as a man who speaks with a forked tongue. At the start of the story, he seems to have a definite plan for giving his family a better life. But, we soon enough discover, he's no great over achiever -- much less a totally goodmoral minded man. His slave child, Isaiah ( Eugene Jackson) is one telltale sign of this. Upon his family's first trek to a Sunday morning church service -- one at which, curiously enough, Cravat is to give the sermon -- Isaiah tries to come along, dressed up like Cravat, longtail suit, holster, gun and all. Cravat tells him to go home. "" Ya ' all doesn't want me to come with ya ' ta church? "" Isaiah says with a pout. "" No! "" Cravat corrects him, patting him on the shoulder. "" You don't understand! I want you to stay and guard the house. And if anyone at all comes along ... you shoot him dead! "" The characters -- not to mention the actors -- in "" Cimarron "" couldn't act their way out of burlap sacks, despite their obvious efforts. And nothing in the script was any too commendable, either. ( Granted: the incomparable Edna May Oliver -- notorious for playing the Red Queen in Alice In Wonderland, also released in 1931-actually manages to look good, pulling off her portrayal of a pompous old woman, which is what she's also been bestknown for.) But, aside from that, well ... Yancy Yates isn't popular in town from the first week he arrives, and one of the outlaws decides to shoot Cravat's white hat off as he and his wife ( Irene Dunne) are casually walking by. Despite her anger with the man who fired the bullet, Cravat just takes it completely in stride. Not only was this story not "" shooting for realism "", but it was very lacking in several key areas: e.g., Cravat's newspaper isn't ever really seen. ( Bulletins and posters, yes -- but not any newspaper.) Perhaps strangest of all, though: this is set in a small town in Kansas. Yet, for some reason or other, Yancy Cravat is deadset on calling his paper "" The Oklahoma WigWam. "" Really good westerns have always been very few and far between -- the only exceptions being Clint Eastwood's socalled "" spaghetti westerns "" of the late ' 60s to early ' 70s. Cliche westerns, on the other hand, are a dimeadozen. If you like cliche westerns, "" Cimarron "" will do you proud -- but, as for me ... it did me embarrassment."
